            <h2> Suddenly you feel something slimy rub against your hand. In a blur of movement, a snake jumps out and sinks it's teeth in to your neck.
                    You hit the snake repeatively, and it dies. But the damage is already done. You sit in painful agony for hours, then finally the merciful grasp of death, envelops you.</h2>
