            Ah!
            I scared you!
            No, you didn't.
            Okay!
            Remember our field trip rules, everyone.
            Uh, no pushing, no biting,
            and no fire breathing!
            What did I just say?
            Eighteen, nineteen...
            Okay, we're missing one.
            Who are we missing?
            Oh. Mike Wazowski.
            Thanks, Joe.
            Good luck finishing
            your crossword puzzle.
            Sorry, Michael.
            I didn't see you.
            That's okay.
            When I was on the bus,
            I found a nickel!
            I wish I had pockets.
            Okay, everyone, partner up.
            Get your field trip buddy.
            Jeremy! You and me?
            Okay, no biggie.
            Hailey? No?
            Pairing up with Claire?
            Great choice.
            She's a good egg.
            Russell.
            Mike? Wazowski?
            We car-pool?
            - We're cousins.
            - Hey!
            Okay. Good catching up.
            Well, Michael, it looks like
            it's you and me again.
            Come on, Karen.
            We're falling behind.
            Please don't call me Karen.
            Now, stay close together.
            We're entering
            a very dangerous area.
            Welcome to the Scare Floor.
            Wow!
            This is where we collect the Scream Energy
            to power our whole world.
            And can anyone tell me whose job
            it is to go get that scream?
            Scarers!
            That's right!
            Now, which one of you can
            give me the scariest roar?
            Me, me, me!
            Oh! Sir! Right here!
            Little green guy,
            two o'clock!
            No, it's like this.
            Hey, guys, watch this one.
            Hey, I got a really good...
            Wow!
            Whoa.
            Well, hey there, kids.
            Are you on a tour with your school?
            - Yeah!
            - Yes.
            We're here to learn
            about Scream Energy
            and what it takes
            to be a Scarer.
            Well, hey, you're in luck,
            because I just happen to be a Scarer.
            I learned everything
            I know from my school,
            Monsters University.
            Whoa.
            It's the best
            Scaring School there is.
            You wish!
            Fear Tech's the best.
            Okay. You guys
            watch us and tell me
            which school's the best.
            All right?
            MU is.
            Let's go, everybody!
            West coast coming onli.
            Scarers coming o.
            Oops.
            Stop right there.
            Don't cross over
            that safety line.
            Human children
            are extremely toxic.
            Look at that!
            Whoa! Hey, guys,
            watch the eye! Ow!
            Look at that! It's amazing!
            I know!
            - Wow!
            - Excuse me. Fellas.
            How about we do
            tallest in the back?
            Look, he's going to
            do a real scare!
            Cool. I want to
            be a Scarer.
            Yeah. Me, too.
            Come on, guys.
            I want to see.
            Out of the way, Wazowski.
            You don't belong
            on a Scare Floor.
            Brian! Do not step
            over the line.
            Mrs. Graves,
            Michael went over the line.
            Michael!
            See?
            I told you. He's fine.
            Well,
            I thought I heard something.
            What?
            Are you okay?
            You could have gotten hurt!
            I don't understand
            how this could happen!
            That was real dangerous, kid.
            I didn't even know you were in there.
            Wow. I didn't even know
            you were in there.
            Not bad, kid.
            Michael, what do you have
            to say for yourself?
            How do I become a Scarer?
            Monsters University!
            Anybody getting off?
            Well, everyone,
            I don't mean to get emotional,
            but everything in my life
            has led to this moment.
            Let it not be just the
            beginning of my dream
            but the beginning
            of all of our dreams.
            Gladys, promise me
            you'll keep auditioning.
            Marie, Mr. Right is
            out there somewhere.
            Phil, keep using the ointment
            till that thing goes away.
            I wish you all the best.
            Thank you all so much!
            I'm welling up with tears.
            Now, get off.
            Hello. How are you doing?
            Ah!
            Whoo-hoo!
            Stroke! Stroke!
            Come on,
            put all you have into it!
            Stroke! Stroke!
            Okay! First thing on
            my list, get registered.
            Hey there, freshman.
            I'm Jay the R.A.,
            and I'm here to say that
            registration is thataway!
            Okay, Jay.
            Have a great first day.
            Hey, I'm Kay!
            Here's your orientation packet.
            Thanks, Kay.
            You can drop your bags off here
            and get your
            picture taken with Trey.
            Say hooray!
            Hooray!
            I can't believe it.
            I'm officially
            a college student!
            Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,
            and I'll be giving you your
            orientation tour on this perfect day!
            Here are the labs
            where students learn
            to design and build the
            doors to the human world.
            Looks like the professor
            is about to test a door!
            The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet,
            three meals a day.
            I personally believe we have some
            of the best chefs in the world.
            Oh! Yeah!
            Yeah!
            The campus offers
            a wide variety of majors,
            but the crown jewel of MU
            is the Scaring School.
            Welcome to the debate team.
            We're happy to have you.
            I disagree for
            the following reasons.
            True happiness is a

            Hey, hey, hey! Come
            join the improv club.
            You'll wish you were a...

            We sponsor the annual Scare Games.
            The Scare what now?
            The Scare Games!
            A super-intense
            Scaring competition!
            They're crazy dangerous,
            so anything could happen.
            A bunch of guys went
            to the hospital last year!
            You could totally die.
            And it's worth it.
            You get a chance to prove
            that you are the best!
            Cool.
            Wazowski, Room 319.
            You know, your roommate
            is a Scaring major, too.
            "Hello, I'm your roommate."
            Oh, that's too bland.
            Don't force it.
            Just let it happen.
            Your lifelong best friend
            is right behind this door.
            Hey there.
            I'm your roomie.
            Name's Randy Boggs.
            Scaring major.
            Oh!
            Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.
            I can tell we're going
            to be best chums, Mike.
            Take whichever bed you want.
            I wanted you to
            have first dibs.
            Ahh!
            You just disappeared.
            Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class,
            I'll be a joke.
            No, it's totally great.
            You got to use it.
            Really?
            Yeah, but lose the glasses.
            They give it away.
            Huh.
            Okay!
            Unpack. Check.
            Hang posters. Check.
            Now I just need to ace my classes,
            graduate with honors,
            and become
            the greatest Scarer ever.
            Boy, I wish I had
            your confidence, Mike.
            Aren't you even
            a little nervous?
            Actually, no.
            I've been waiting
            for this my whole life.
            I just can't
            wait to get started.
            Oh, man! I can't be
            late on the first day!
            Wow.
            You got to be kidding me.
            I'm so nervous!
            Relax. It will be fine.
            Good morning, students.
            Welcome to Scaring 101.
            I am Professor Knight.
            Now I'm sure all of you were the
            scariest monster in your town.
            Well, bad news, kids.
            You're in my town now,
            and I do not scare easily.
            Dean Hardscrabble.
            This is a pleasant surprise.
            She's a legend.
            She broke
            the all-time Scare Record
            with the scream
            in that very can!
            I don't mean to interrupt.
            I just thought I'd drop by
            to see the terrifying faces
            joining my program.
            Well, I'm sure my students
            would love to hear
            a few words of inspiration.
            Inspiration? Very well.
            Scariness is the true
            measure of a monster.
            If you're not scary
            what kind of a monster are you?
            It's my job to make
            great students greater,
            not make mediocre students
            less mediocre.
            That is why at the end of the
            semester there will be a final exam.
            Fail that exam and you are
            out of the Scaring program.
            So,
            I should hope you're all properly inspired.
            All right. All right.
            Who can tell me the properties
            of an effective roar?
            Yes?
            There are actually five.
            Those include
            the roar's resonance,
            the duration of the roar,
            and the...
            Whoops. Sorry.
            I heard someone say "roar,"
            so I just kind of went for it.
            Oh, excuse me, sorry.
            I didn't mean to scare you there.
            Hey, how you doing?
            Very impressive, Mister...
            Sullivan.
            Jimmy Sullivan.
            Sullivan.
            Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?
            Yeah. He's my dad.
            He's a Sullivan!
            I should have known.
            I expect big things from you.
            Well, you won't
            be disappointed.
            Uh... I'm sorry.
            Should I keep going?
            No, no.
            Mr. Sullivan's covered it.
            Huh.
            Everyone take out
            your Scaring textbooks
            and open them to chapter one.
            Hey, bub.
            Can I borrow a pencil?
            I forgot all my stuff.
            Ah! All right. Yes.
            There we go. That will get it.
            Mmm... Yeah.
            Come on, Mike.
            It's a fraternity
            and sorority party.
            We have to go!
            If we flunk that Scaring final,
            we are done.
            I'm not taking any chances.
            You've got
            the whole semester to study,
            but this might
            be our only chance
            to get in good
            with the cool kids.
            That's why I made these cupcakes.
            Oops.
            That could
            have been embarrassing.
            When I'm a Scarer,
            life will be a nonstop party.
            Stay out of trouble, wild man.
            Wild man.
            What the...
            Archie!
            Boo!
            Hey! What are you...
            Wait... You're shushing me?
            Hey! Hey! You can't...
            - Where did he go?
            - He's dead meat.
            That guy's in big trouble.
            Yeah, he is.
            Hey, guys!
            Over here!
            Fear Tech dummies.
            Oh, oh!
            Sorry about that, buddy.
            Why are you in my room?
            Your room? This is my...
            This is not my room.
            Archie! Come here, boy.
            Archie?
            Archie the Scare Pig.
            He's Fear Tech's mascot.
            Why is it here?
            I stole it. Going to
            take it to the RORs.
            The what?
            Roar Omega Roar.
            The top fraternity on campus.
            They only accept
            the highly elite.
            Okay, I'll lift the bed,
            you grab the pig.
            Ready? One, two, three.
            What? No, no... Oh! What...
            That's it.
            Don't let go.
            Careful. He's a biter.
            - Whoa! Whoa, hey...
            - Whoa!
            I got him!
            Uh-oh! Whoa!
            That was awesome!
            What am I doing?
            James P. Sullivan.
            Mike Wazowski.
            Listen,
            it was quite delightful meeting you
            and whatever that is,
            but if you don't mind,
            I have to study my Scaring.
            You don't need
            to study Scaring.
            You just do it.
            Really? I think there's a
            little more to it than that.
            But, hey, thanks
            for stopping by.
            Let go of that!
            My hat!
            My pig!
            Ooh!
            Hey! Come here!
            Hey!
            Catch it!
            Come back here!
            Ooh! Yeah!
            Ride it to frat row!
            Hey!
            Whoa... Ow!
            Wow!
            Whoa!
            Go, go, go!
            Hey...
            Come on! Hey!
            Ooh!
            Cupcake?
            Whoa...
            Ooh!
            Got it!
            Fear Tech's mascot!
            MU rules!
            M-U! M-U! M-U!
            Did you see him catch that pig?
            You are Jaws Theta Chi
            material, freshman.
            Oh, thanks.
            I don't know...
            No, no, no.
            He's an Omega Howl guy.
            Back off.
            We saw him first.
            No way. We did!
            I'll take it
            from here, gentlemen.
            Johnny Worthington,
            president of Roar Omega Roar.
            What's your name, big blue?
            Jimmy Sullivan.
            Friends call me Sulley.
            This guy's a Sullivan?
            Like the famous Sullivan?
            I can't believe it!
            That is crazy!
            Chet, calm down.
            I'm sorry.
            Sulley, any freshman with the guts
            to pull off a stunt like that
            has got "Future Scarer"
            written all over him.
            Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
            That took guts.
            Slow down, squirt.
            This party is for Scare students only.
            Oh, sorry, killer,
            but you might want to hang out
            with someone
            a little more your speed.
            Uh... They look fun!
            Oh, hey there. Want
            to join Oozma Kappa?
            We have cake.
            Go crazy.
            Is that a joke?
            Sulley, talk to your friend.
            Oh, he's not really
            my friend, but sure.
            You heard him.
            This is a party for Scare students.
            I am a Scare student.
            I mean for Scare
            students who actually,
            you know, have a chance.
            Aw, snap!
            My chances are
            just as good as yours.
            You're not even in the
            same league with me.
            Just wait, hotshot.
            I'm going to scare circles
            around you this year.
            Oh, okay.
            I'd like to see that.
            Oh, don't worry. You will.
            Ready position.
            Common crouch.
            I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth.
            Basic snarl.
            Show me some slobber.
            Drool is a tool,
            kids. Use it.
            Now here is a monster
            who looks like a Scarer.
            You want a hope of passing
            this class, you better eat,
            breathe, and sleep Scaring.
            Yeah!
            Give me another one.
            Fear of spiders.
            Arachnophobia.
            Fear of thunder.
            Keraunophobia.
            Fear of chopsticks!
            Consecotaleophobia.
            What is this, kindergarten?
            Give me a hard one.
            Go Monsters U!
            You know what to do!
            The answer is C, fangs.
            Well done, Mr. Wazowski.
            A bowl of spiders!
            Correct!
            A clown running in the dark!
            Right again.
            Warts, boils, and moles,
            in that order.
            Outstanding!
            Ah! Whoa!
            Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
            Ah!
            Ogre slump.
            Zombie snarl.
            Dominant silverback gorilla.
            That is some remarkable
            improvement, Michael.
            One frightening face does not
            a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.
            A Tauntaun grimace
            with extra slobber.
            You got it!
            That's what I'm saying.
            I am going to wipe the floor
            with that little know-it-all.
            Yes, you are, big blue.
            Hey, wait.
            What are you guys...
            It's just a precaution.
            RORs are the best Scarers
            on campus, Sullivan.
            Can't have a member getting
            shown up by a beach ball.
            Whoo-hoo!
            I am on a roll.
            I'm going to destroy that guy.
            Well, then you'll get
            this back right away.
            It's time to start delivering
            on that Sullivan name.
            Today's final will judge your
            ability to assess a child's fear
            and perform the appropriate
            Scare in the Scare Simulator.
            The Child Sensitivity
            Level will be raised
            from Bed-wetter
            to Heavy Sleeper,
            so give it
            everything you've got.
            Dean Hardscrabble is
            with us this morning
            to see who will be moving on
            in the Scaring program
            and who will not.
            Let's get started.
            I am a five-year-old girl afraid
            of spiders and Santa Claus.
            Which Scare do you use?
            Uh...
            That's a Seasonal
            Creep and Crawl.
            Demonstrate.
            Results will be posted
            outside my office. Next.
            Focus.
            Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
            Yes!
            Hey. Do you mind?
            Don't mind at all.
            Come on, Mike.
            Let's just move.
            Stay out of my way.
            Unlike you, I had to work hard
            to get into the Scare program.
            That's because
            you don't belong here.
            That's what I thought.
            Whoa! Whoa...
            I'm so sorry.
            It was an accident.
            What? This?
            My one souvenir from
            a lifetime of Scaring?
            Accidents happen, don't they.
            The important thing
            is no one got hurt.
            You're taking
            this remarkably well.
            Now, let's continue the exams.
            Mr. Wazowski,
            I'm a five-year-old girl
            on a farm in Kansas
            afraid of lightning.
            Which Scare do you use?
            Shouldn't I go up on the...
            Which Scare do you use?
            That is a Shadow Approach
            with a Crackle Holler.
            Demonstrate.
            Stop. Thank you.
            But I didn't get to...
            I've seen enough.
            I'm a seven-year-old boy...
            I wasn't finished.
            I don't need to know
            any of that stuff to scare.
            That "stuff"
            would've informed you
            that this particular child
            is afraid of snakes.
            So a roar wouldn't make him scream,
            it would make him cry,
            alerting his parents,
            exposing the monster world,
            destroying life as we know it,
            and of course
            we can't have that.
            So I'm afraid I cannot
            recommend that you continue
            in the Scaring program.
            Good day.
            Wait, what?
            But I'm a Sullivan.
            Well then, I'm sure your family
            will be very disappointed.
            And, Mr. Wazowski,
            what you lack is something
            that cannot be taught.
            You're not scary.
            You will not be continuing
            in the Scaring program.
            Please. Let me try the simulator.
            I'll surprise you.
            Surprise me?
            I doubt that very much.
            Welcome back.
            I hope everyone
            had a pleasant bre.
            Some say that a career as a
            scream-can designer is boring,
            unchallenging, a waste
            of a monster's potential.
            Open your textbooks
            to chapter three.
            We will now plunge
            into the rich history
            of scream-can design.
            Out of my way!
            Coming through!
            Oh, sorry. Ha-ha!
            Welcome to this year's
            Greek Scare Games kickoff.
            The Scare Game!
            Yeah!
            Okay, relax.
            We have a special guest,
            the founder of the games,
            Dean Hardscrabble.
            Good afterno.
            As a student,
            I created these gas
            as a friendly competition,
            but be prepared.
            To take home the troph,
            you must be the most
            fearsome monsters on campus.
            So good luck, and may
            the best monsters wi.
            All right, everybody.
            We're closing down sign-,
            so we'll see you all...
            Wait!
            I'm signing up!
            What?
            Uh...
            You have to be in a fraterniy to compete.
            Behold the next winning
            fraternity of the Scare Games,
            the brothers, my brothers,
            of Oozma Kappa!
            Hi.
            Mr. Wazowski,
            what are you doing?
            You just said the winners are the
            most fearsome monsters on campus.
            If I win,
            it means you kicked out the best Scarer
            in the whole school.
            That won't happen.
            How about a little wager?
            If I win, you let me back
            in the Scaring program.
            And what would that prove?
            That you were wrong.
            Very well.
            If you win, I will
            let your entire team
            into the Scare program.
            But if you lose,
            you will leave
            Monsters University.
            Deal.
            Now all you need to do is find
            enough members to compete.
            We need six guys, right?
            Sorry, chief.
            We count bodies, not heads.
            That dude counts as one.
            Anybody else want to join our team?
            Anyone at all?
            Excuse me.
            Sorry. I'm late.
            Can I squeeze by you?
            Randy!
            Randy, thank goodness.
            I need you on my team.
            Oh. Sorry.
            I'm already on a team.
            Boggs.
            I'm finally in with
            the cool kids, Mike.
            Don't blow this for me.
            Do the thing.
            Oh! Where did he go?
            Please, anybody.
            I need one more monster.
            Just one more!
            Yeah, sorry.
            Doesn't look good.
            We have to move on.
            Your team doesn't qualify.
            Yes, it does!
            The star player
            has just arrived.
            No way! Someone else!
            Please! Anyone else.
            We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
            Is he on your team or not?
            Come on! Let's go!
            Fine! Yes,
            he's on my team.
            Good luck.
            All right, Wazowski,
            what's the plan?
            This is a fraternity house?
            Hey there, teammateys!
            Come on aboard!
            As the president
            of Oozma Kappa,
            it is my honor to welcome
            you to your new home.
            We call this room
            "Party Central."
            Technically,
            we haven't actually had a party here yet.
            But when we do, we'll be ready!
            Whoo!
            The hot cocoa train
            is coming through! Whoa!
            Next stop... You!
            I would like to
            start us off first by...
            So, you guys
            are Scaring majors?
            We were!
            None of us lasted very long.
            I guess we just weren't what old
            Hardscrabble was looking for.
            Don Carlton, mature student.
            Thirty years in
            the textile industry
            and then old dandy Don
            got downsized.
            Figured I could throw
            myself a pity party,
            or go back to school
            and learn the computers.
            Hello. I'm Terry
            with a "Y"...
            And I'm Terri with an "I"!
            I'm a dance major!
            And I'm not.
            Five, six, seven, eight!
            Seven, eight, turn! And...
            Why didn't you turn?
            Because we never
            agreed to do this!
            You said this was
            going to be cool!
            No one said
            this was gonna be cool.
            Now I'm embarrassed.
            Now you're embarrassed?
            Yes, because
            it's in front of people!
            You should wake up embarrassed.
            Hey, hey, hey!
            I'm Art!
            New Age philosophy major.
            Excited to live with you
            and laugh with you,
            and cry with you.
            Thought you might like
            to keep a dream journal.
            Guess that leaves me.
            Ah!
            My name's Scott Squibbles.
            My friends call me Squishy.
            I'm undeclared, unattached,
            and unwelcome pretty much
            everywhere but here.
            Now that we've all been introduced,
            as captain of our team...
            So, basically, you guys have
            no Scaring experience?
            Not a lot!
            But now we've got you!
            You're about the scariest
            fella I've ever seen.
            Even with them pink polka dots.
            Aw, thanks.
            Actually, I think I bring
            the whole package.
            Your hands are
            as big as my face!
            He's like a mountain with fur!
            Oh, come on.
            I don't even work out.
            - Yeah, me neither.
            - I don't want to get too big.
            We thought our dreams were over,
            but Mike said if we win,
            they're letting us in
            the Scaring program.
            We're going to be real Scarers!
            The best!
            You betcha!
            Yeah!
            Right.
            And here's what you've been
            waiting for, fellas.
            Your very own
            Oozma Kappa bedroom.
            Oh... Great!
            We're sharing this room?
            We'll let you guys get settled.
            Anything you need,
            you just give a big holler-oonie!
            Okay, thanks, buddy.
            Are you kidding me?
            Look, they don't
            need to be good.
            I'm going to
            carry the whole team.
            Really? And who's
            going to carry you?
            Hey, if you want to
            go back to can design,
            you know where the door is.
            Great.
            Guys?
            Anybody home?
            Um...
            Hello?
            Fellas?
            Do you pledge your souls
            to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?
            Ow!
            Do you swear to
            keep secret...
            all that you learn here?
            No matter how horrifying?
            Hey!
            Will you take the sacred
            oath of the...
            For crying out loud.
            Sweetie!
            Turn the lights on
            while you're down here!
            You're going to ruin your eyes!
            Mom!
            We're doing an initiation!
            Oh, scary.
            Well, carry on.
            Just pretend I'm not here.
            This is my mom's house.
            Do you promise to look out
            for your brothers...
            no matter what the peril?
            Will you defend Oozma Kappa
            no matter how dangerous?
            No matter how insurmountable
            the odds may be?
            From evils both
            great and small?
            In the face of
            unending pain and...
            Oh, forget it!
            You're in.
            Look, we know
            we're no one's first choice
            for a fraternity,
            so it means a lot
            to have you here with us.
            Can't wait to start Scaring
            with you, brothers.
            Time for a celebration!
            Yeah!
            Grab the couch cushions,
            gentlemen,
            because we're building a fort!
            Mom, can we
            stay up late tonight?
            Mmm, I know you're a princess
            and I'm just a stable boy.
            Yuck!
            Mom! What are you doing?
            Your grubby paw was in my bed!
            Were you kissing my hand?
            No. And what about you
            with all your shedding?
            I don't shed.
            Really.
            Uh...
            Excuse me.
            I just want to get my stuff.
            Would you just...
            Oh, hey. Come on!
            Let me get my stuff!
            My butt!
            First morning in the house.
            That's going in the album!
            Guys!
            We got a letter!
            A letter?
            We never get mail.
            Oh! Sorry.
            It's stuck.
            Would you...
            Give me that!
            Tentacles.
            They're sticky.
            It's the first event
            of the Scare Games.
            "A child's room
            is where you scare,
            "but avoid
            the toxicity lurking there."
            Wait a minute.
            Where do they want us to meet?
            Of all the sewers on campus,
            this one has always been my favorite.
            Art, you've been here before?
            I have a life outside of the house,
            you know.
            Welcome to your
            worst nightmare,
            the Scare Games!
            Scare Games! Scare Games!
            Yes!
            Yes, I love it!
            I love this energy!
            Okay. Okay, everybody.
            Let's hear it for the frats and sororities
            competing in
            this year's games...
            Jaws Theta Chi!
            Python Nu Kappa!
            Slugma Slugma Kappa!
            Roar Omega Roar!
            Eta Hiss Hiss!
            And finally, Oozma Kappa.
            Yay! Whoo-hoo!
            Hi, Mom!
            Smile!
            Let's begin
            the first competition,
            the Toxicity Challenge!
            Human children are toxic!
            And anything
            they touch is toxic.
            We don't have any human toys,
            but thanks to MU's
            biology department,
            we found a close second,
            the stinging glow urchin!
            Trust me when I say,
            you are not gonna want
            to touch this bad boy!
            I want to touch it.
            And you certainly don't want
            to touch any of its friends.
            Yeah, I want to touch them.
            This is the starting line.
            The light at the end of the
            tunnel is the finish line.
            And whoever comes in last is
            eliminated from the games.
            Mike...
            What is it?
            Does that mean if
            we lose, we're out?
            Don't worry, Smoothie.
            Squishy!
            Squishy.
            We're not going to lose,
            because we have everything
            we need to win right here.
            Heart.
            No! Me. I'm going to
            win the race for us.
            All right, all right.
            That's very cute,
            but move, move, move.
            I'm going to win this.
            It's an obstacle course.
            What are you going to do? Roar at it?
            I can get through faster than you,
            little guy.
            Take your place at
            the starting line!
            This is all about teamwork.
            Everybody, stick together.
            I'm going to beat you
            over that finish line.
            Get ready to eat my dust.
            Hey, guys, should we huddle up?
            Attention, teams.
            One last thing.
            Scarers work in the dark.
            I want to go home!
            On your marks...
            Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.
            Thanks! We're going to
            rip you to pieces!
            What?
            Get set...
            Go!
            I'm going to touch them!
            Ow!
            Come on!
            Uh, guys!
            We're falling behind a little! Fellas!
            Cheese and crackers!
            Son of a moustache!
            Salisbury steak, that hurts!
            Is that as fast as you can go?
            Just getting started!
            What the...
            Whoa! Ah!
            Oh... Ah!
            That's got to hurt!
            Ow, ow, ow...
            Ooh!
            Terry!
            Don't worry, we'll be fi...
            Ha-ha!
            Oh...
            Uh-oh. Yikes!
            Ow! Ow, ow, ow...
            Roar Omega Roar wins!
            Take that, Wazowski!
            Are you delirious?
            I beat you!
            Get your eye checked!
            Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!
            Hey! Second place
            ain't bad.
            Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!
            What?
            Your whole team has to
            cross the finish line.
            Third place, EEKs!
            - Fourth place, PNKs!
            - No.
            Fifth place, HSS!
            No, no, no!
            And in last place,
            Oozma Kappa.
            I can't feel my anything.
            Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa
            has been eliminated!
            No.
            Don't look so surprised,
            Mr. Wazowski.
            It would have taken
            a miracle for you to...
            Attention, everyone.
            We have an announcement.
            Jaws Theta Chi has
            been disqualified.
            The use of illegal protective
            gel is cause for elimination.
            What!
            Which means Oozma Kappa
            is back in the games!
            It's a miracle!
            Your luck will
            run out, eventually.
            This is going to be
            harder than I thought.
            Okay!
            Listen up, Oozmas.
            Now, we're going to have to start
            winning these things together,
            so that means I'm going to need
            each of you guys
            to pull your own weight.
            Mike?
            What is it?
            We've made a list of our
            strengths and weaknesses.
            In high school,
            I was the master of the silent scare.
            I could sneak up
            on a field mouse
            in a pillow factory.
            Sorry! They get stickier
            when I'm sweaty.
            Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.
            We're experts in the ancient
            craft of close-up magic.
            It's all about misdirection.
            Uh...
            I have an extra toe.
            Not with me, of course.
            Guys, one slip-up on the next event,
            and we're goners.
            So for this to work,
            I'm gonna need you to take
            every instinct you have
            and bury it deep, deep down.
            Done.
            From now on,
            we are of one mind.
            My mind.
            Oh, please.
            I will tell you exactly what to do,
            and how to do it.
            Uh... Okay, Mike.
            Seems about right.
            All right.
            Give me scary steps.
            Fifty up and down,
            right now. Let's go!
            You're wasting your time.
            We need a new team.
            We can't just "get a new team"!
            I checked this morning.
            It's against the rules.
            What if we disguised a new team
            to look like the old team?
            Oh, no, no.
            We are not cheating.
            It's not cheating.
            I'm just, you know,
            leveling the playing field.
            Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
            but what do you want me to do?
            They're not exactly the
            scariest group in the world.
            Oh, a ladybug!
            Make a wish! Make a wish!
            This is not going to work.
            Where are you going?
            We're training.
            I'm a Sullivan.
            That's not enough.
            You're all over the place.
            You're charging
            ahead when you...
            Bup, bup, bup!
            You tell them what
            to do but not me.
            So long, Coach.
            Okay, Oozmas...
            Boy, we need to get you a bell.
            Listen up. "If a kid hears you coming,
            they'll call Mom or Dad,
            "then you'd better run fast
            or things will get bad."
            Huh?
            In the next event,
            if even one of us gets caught,
            we're all out.
            So remember,
            do exactly what I do.
            We are at the
            halfway point of the second event,
            and things are
            getting interesting.
            Got it.
            Only two teams left.
            Who will make it
            out with their flag,
            and who will be eliminated?
            In a real Scare,
            you do not want to get
            caught by a kid's parent.
            And in this event,
            you do not want to get caught by
            the librarian.
            Quiet.
            What's so scary about a
            little old librarian?
            I said, "Quiet."
            Faster.
            Slow and steady.
            Slow and steady.
            Slow and steady.
            Slow and steady.
            Sullivan!
            Sullivan!
            Hmm.
            Whew!
            Ooh!
            No!
            Five, six, seven, eight!
            Look over here!
            Is that legal?
            You better believe it, mop top!
            The only rule is
            don't get caught.
            Whoo!
            - Ooh!
            - Hey! Over here!
            Come and get me!
            Come and get me! Whoo-hoo!
            Guys, what are you doing?
            They said don't
            let her catch you.
            But they didn't say how!
            Move it! Move it!
            Move it! Come on!
            Whoa!
            Whew!
            We did it!
            No, we didn't.
            We forgot the flag!
            Mike?
            Way to go, Squishy!
            Way to go, Squishy!
            How?
            Misdirection.
            The EEKs have been eliminated
            and Oozma Kappa live
            to scare another day!
            We're OK!
            We're OK! We're OK!
            I've never felt so alive!
            We were awesome!
            Okay, look.
            That wasn't real Scaring.
            It was better
            than what you did.
            You should've
            stuck to my strategy.
            Whatever.
            Talk to me when we start
            the real Scaring.
            Hey! You guys
            going to the party?
            Oh, I think you've
            got the wrong guys.
            - We don't get invited to...
            - Party?
            The mid-games mixer
            at the RORs'.
            It's for the top Scare Teams.
            You're one of us now, right?
            See you there!
            Did you hear that?
            I can't believe it!
            Uh-uh. Bad idea.
            This is great.
            They're finally seeing us as real Scarers.
            We're going!
            Do young people still dance?
            Because my moves
            are a little rusty.
            Oh, we forgot to
            bring a hostess gift.
            We can't go in there without
            some scented candles.
            Calm down.
            We earned this.
            What if there's a lull
            in the conversation?
            I never know what
            to... You know...
            Say?
            How are you so good at this?
            You just took on
            an angry 50-foot librarian,
            and you're afraid
            of a little party?
            Take a deep breath...
            and in you go!
            Hello.
            It's Oozma Kappa!
            These guys are crazy!
            What you did today was insane!
            That was awesome!
            Oozma Kappa,
            tonight we party like Scarers!
            I've never stayed up
            this late in my life!
            Hey, quiet! Quiet!
            Quiet down,
            you can-wranglers.
            All right.
            On behalf of the RORs,
            we'd like to congratulate all the
            teams that have made it this far.
            All, right,
            let's hear it for the PNKs!
            I love that trick!
            Never gets old. HSS!
            Very creepy.
            And finally,
            the surprise team of the Scare Games,
            Oozma Kappa!
            Come on over, guys.
            Now, I got to admit, fellas,
            I thought you were
            a bunch of nobodies.
            But, boy, was I wrong.
            Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!
            Oozma Kappa!
            Oh!
            What?
            The most adorable
            monsters on campus.
            Ooh! Oh!
            Release the stuffed animals.
            Faced!
            - Don't worry.
            - Nobody reads the school paper.
            Yeah,
            but I'm pretty sure they read the quad.
            Whoo-hoo!
            Thank you very much.
            Okay. Would you like that
            with two sleeves or four?
            Thanks.
            Tell your friends.
            Hey! What do you
            think you're doing?
            Raising a little
            money for charity.
            Yeah? Well, stop it.
            You want us to stop raising money
            for charity? That's not cool.
            This guy hates charity!
            I want you to stop
            making us look like fools.
            Hey, you're making yourselves
            look like fools.
            Let's be honest, boys.
            You're never going
            to be real Scarers,
            because real Scarers
            look like us.
            But, hey, if you really want
            to work for a Scare company
            they're always
            hiring in the mailroom.
            Guys, hold on!
            Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
            Don't listen to him.
            We just need to keep trying.
            No, you need to stop trying!
            You can train monsters
            like this all you want,
            but you can't
            change who they are.
            Mike...
            We appreciate everything you've done,
            but he's right.
            No matter how much we train,
            we'll never look like them.
            We're built
            for other things.
            Sorry, squirt!
            Some monsters just aren't
            cut out for the big leagues.
            The big leagues.
            Guys.
            We're going on
            a little field trip.
            My tentacle fell asleep.
            Thanks, Mom.
            Have fun, kids!
            I'll just be here
            listening to my tunes.
            Hey, uh, where are we?
            The big leagues.
            Holy roly-poly.
            Wow.
            Nice fence.
            This is amazing, Mike.
            We're not stopping here.
            This is crazy.
            We're going to get arrested!
            Oh, wow.
            Whoa...
            Oh!
            All Scare Floors now activ.
            West coast coming online.
            Scarers coming out.
            Look at them.
            They're going
            into the human world,
            and they don't
            even look scared!
            Wow.
            Take a good look, fellas.
            See what they
            all have in common?
            Uh... No, not really.
            Exactly. There's no
            one type of Scarer.
            The best Scarers use their
            differences to their advantage.
            Wow.
            Terri? Look.
            Hey!
            Look at that old feller
            racking up the big numbers!
            Don, that old fella is
            Earl "The Terror" Thompson!
            What? Where?
            That's really him?
            He held the Scare
            Record for three years!
            Oh! Third door from the end!
            Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!
            Look! It's
            "Screaming" Bob Gunderson!
            I still have his rookie card.
            Me, too!
            Doesn't have the speed anymore,
            but his
            technique is flawless.
            Technique is flawless.
            You collected Scare Cards, huh?
            Yep. 450 of them.
            Impressive.
            I have 6,000 still in mint condition,
            but, you know,
            450 is pretty good, too.
            Hey, look at me!
            I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson!
            Whoa!
            Oh, that's great!
            That's
            a pretty good one, Squish.
            I've been a real jerk.
            So have I.
            But it's not too late.
            We could be a great team.
            We just need to
            start working together.
            Hey!
            What are you doing up there?
            I can't go back to jail!
            Come on!
            They're right behind us!
            Get back here!
            Up there! Get them!
            Whoo-hoo-hoo!
            Thanks, brother!
            Don't mention it.
            I'm fine, really!
            It's just a little heart attack.
            Aw... I want
            a piece of that action!
            Mom! Start the car!
            What?
            Start the car!
            Stop the bar?
            The car! Start the car!
            Oh! Okay.
            Come on, come on,
            come on, come on!
            Get in! Get in!
            Mom, go!
            Seatbelts.
            Okay, go!
            Does anyone want gum?
            Just drive!
            Okay. Here we go!
            Oh, yeah!
            Let's break in somewhere else!
            Rise and shine!
            Scary feet, scary feet...
            The kid is in the bathroom!
            Scary feet, scary feet...
            Oh, he's back!
            Wake up!
            Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!
            Do I hear thirty-nine?
            Come on!
            Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
            you're looking good.
            "To frighten a child
            is the point of a Scare.
            "If you frighten a teen,
            then Scarer beware."
            Okay, scare the little kid.
            Avoid the teenager!
            I'm on the phone!
            No one understands me!
            Whatever.
            But, Daddy, I love him!
            First place, Roar Omega Roar!
            Second place, Oozma Kappa!
            Whoo!
            Third place, HSS.
            You're lame.
            "Someone is coming,
            this could ruin your night.
            "Stay hidden, take cover,

            You got 10 seconds.
            Go!

            Standing out in the open.
            And there should be one more.
            How did I do?
            Oh! Not too
            shabby, Don!
            Thanks!
            I cannot get down.

            That's what I'm talking about!
            Time to go to work.
            You're out!
            You're out.
            Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.
            Thank you.
            Yeah!
            Yeah!
            We're down to o remaining team,
            Roar Omega Rr and Oozma Ka!
            Which leads us to
            the final event!
            "Every one of your skills
            will be put to the test.
            "The Scare Simulator will
            prove who's the best!"
            Tomorrow night
            you finally get to Scare
            in front of the whole school!
            Enjoy the attention
            while it lasts, boys.
            After you lose,
            no one will remember you.
            Maybe. But when you lose,
            no one will let you forget it.
            Oh, boy. That is
            a good point.
            Hey, Oozmas,
            you guys are awesome!
            You've got to
            teach us your moves.
            Well, then you're gonna
            want to talk to this guy.
            Oh...
            Sure, I can teach you.
            All right. You want to
            hide behind the chair?
            You have to become the chair.
            Thanks for coming, Dean.
            Dean Hardscrabble!
            If we get back into
            the Scaring program,
            I hope there's
            no hard feelings.
            Tomorrow,
            each of you must prove
            that you are undeniably scary.
            And I know for a fact
            that one of you is not.
            No. He works
            harder than anyone.
            Do you think he's scary?
            He's the heart and
            soul of the team!
            Do you think he's scary?
            We're going to win this thing tomorrow,
            Sull, I can feel it!
            We'll finally have
            our lives back on track.
            Hey, Mike?
            You know, you've given me
            a lot of really great tips.
            I'd love to return
            the favor sometime.
            Oh. Yeah, sure.
            Anytime.
            We're doing this now?
            Okay.
            You've memorized
            every textbook,
            every Scare Theory,
            and that is great.
            Hey!
            But now it's time
            to forget all that.
            Just reach deep down
            and let the scary out!
            Huh. Just feel it.
            Exactly. Go wild.
            I don't know. I've kind of
            got my own technique.
            Give it a try.
            Good, but bigger!
            Nope. You're thinking again.
            From the gut!
            Let the animal out!
            Come on! Dig deep!
            Boys!
            It's a school night!
            So, how was that?
            Up top.
            Ha-ha!
            You know,
            it did feel different!
            I feel like it's
            all coming together.
            Yup, this time tomorrow the whole
            school is finally going to see
            what Mike Wazowski can do.
            You're darn right.

            Whoo! Yeah!
            All right!
            It's time to see how terrifying
            you really are,
            in the Scare Simulators!
            But be warne.

            First Scarers to the starting line.
            Okay, just like we planned.
            I'll go first. Then, Don...
            Hold on. Mike's the one
            who started all this
            and I think it's only right if
            he's the one who finishes it.
            I think you should go last.
            Yes!
            Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!
            All right. Don,
            you okay going first?
            I guess I'm as ready
            as I'll ever be.
            Oozma Kappa!
            Go Oozmas!
            I'm gonna do it.
            I'm going to beat this guy.
            Hey, Bruiser!
            You take it easy on grandpa.
            Unleash the beast, Don!
            Okay, then.
            Huh? Huh?
            Thanks for taking
            it easy on grandpa.
            Next group to the starting line.
            Let's do this.
            Yes! Yeah!
            Come on, Art.
            Come on, buddy.
            You can do it.
            Yes!
            Aw!
            Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!
            You got this, Sull.
            And it's all tied up!
            Ah!
            Tough break for the RORs.
            Huh?
            Hearts?
            Huh?
            Way to go, Boggs!
            Yay!
            That's the last time
            I lose to you, Sullivan.
            Worthington and Wazowski,
            to the starting line.
            Hey.
            Don't worry about Hardscrabble.
            Don't worry about anyone else.
            Just go out there and show them
            what Mike Wazowski can do.
            Thanks.
            Don't take the loss too hard.
            You never belonged here anyway.
            Amazing
            performance by Worthington!
            - Johnny, you're my hero!
            - ROR! ROR!
            The Oozmas
            will need a record-breakg
            Scare to win this.
            You don't belong on a Scare Floor.
            No one will remember yo.
            You're not scary.
            Come on! Dig deep!
            Yeah!
            They did it!
            Yeah! Hey!
            We're in the Scare
            program! Yeah!
            Come here, you son of a gun!
            Way to go!
            Yeah!
            Oh! A little stuck.
            Pardon me there,
            Ms. Squibbles.
            It's Sherrie.
            We did it!
            Way to go, Oozma Kappa!
            Thank you!
            Thanks a lot.
            You rule!
            I have never ruled before.
            You guys killed it out there!
            Awesome!
            Hey, Wazowski!
            Come on, let's go, you maniac!
            We're celebrating.
            Mike?
            I did it.
            I can't believe it.
            I'm going to be a Scarer!
            Yeah, yes, you are.
            You hear that?
            Get plenty of rest, kiddo.
            You haven't seen the last
            of Mike Wazowski. Boo!
            I knew I was scary.
            I didn't know I was that scary.
            Yeah,
            we're so scary I guess we broke it.
            Come on.
            It's been tampered with.
            Uh, I don't think you should
            be messing with that.
            Why are my settings different?
            Mike, we should leave.
            Did you do this?
            Mike.
            Did you do this?
            I...
            Yes, I did.
            But you don't understand.
            Why? Why did you do this?
            You know, just in case.
            In case of what?
            You don't think I'm scary.
            Mike...
            You said you believed in me.
            But you're just
            like Hardscrabble.
            You're just like everyone else!
            Look, you'll get
            better and better...
            I'm as scary as you!
            I'm as scary as anyone!
            I just wanted to help.
            No.
            You just wanted
            to help yourself.
            Well, what was
            I supposed to do?
            Let the whole team fail
            because you don't have it?
            So your calculations were a little off.
            That door took me all semester.
            It's too dangerous.
            The professor's just going to shred it.
            There he is, the big guy.
            The first of many
            trophies, I am sure.
            Sullivan.
            Nice work out there.
            I look forward to
            having you back in class.
            Hey, there he is!
            Looks like I was
            wrong about you.
            You're one of us after all.
            Way to go, Sulley!
            Welcome back, broham!
            You are one of us now, okay?
            Anytime you want
            to come hang out
            and do whatever,
            you got a crew.
            You're a ROR, buddy!
            Hey!
            Where are you going?
            You did what?
            My team had
            nothing to do with it.
            It was all me. I cheated.
            I expect you off
            campus by tomorrow.
            Yes, ma'am.
            You're a disgrace
            to this university
            and your family name.
            What's going on?
            Someone broke
            into the door lab!
            What?
            Oh, no.
            Open the door!
            Don't go in there!
            You look funny.
            What?
            I'm so tired.
            What's going on?
            It's the middle of the night.
            A little funny green guy.
            I want to touch it!
            It's so cute!
            James!
            No one goes near that door
            until the authorities arrive.
            You don't think
            that could be...
            It's Mike.
            But he could die out there!
            James, wait!
            We can help.
            Leave it to
            the old master of sales.
            We got a call in,
            but that's the best we can do.
            Ahem!
            Don Carlton, sales.
            Folks, today is your lucky day.
            How many times have you asked
            yourself the following question...
            Arrest him.
            Pardon?
            Spread them, pops!
            Do you mind?
            Don't move!
            What? Sullivan!
            Don't you dare!
            Sullivan! Don't go in there!
            Mike?
            Mike!
            The kids said they
            saw something in the cabin.
            They're calling it an alien.
            It was!
            I saw a little green guy!
            What's the problem, ma'am?
            Mike?
            Bear! A bear in the camp!
            Call this in to headquarters.
            Down this way.
            All right?
            I heard something over here!
            Mike!
            Come on, buddy.
            Let's get you out of here.
            This is all my fault.
            I'm sorry.
            You were right.
            They weren't scared of me.
            I did everything right.
            I wanted it more than anyone.
            And I thought...
            I thought if I wanted it enough,
            I could show everybody that...
            That Mike Wazowski
            is something special.
            And I'm just
            not.
            Look, Mike,
            I know how you feel.
            Don't do that!
            Please, don't do that!
            You do not know how I feel.
            Mike, calm down.
            Monsters like you have everything.
            You don't have to be good.
            You can mess up
            over and over again
            and the whole world loves you.
            Mike...
            You'll never know
            what it's like to fail
            because you were
            born a Sullivan!
            Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
            I'm the Sullivan
            who flunked every test.
            The one who got kicked out
            of the program,
            the one who was so afraid
            to let everyone down
            that I cheated.
            And I lied.
            Mike, I'll never know
            how you feel,
            but you're not
            the only failure here.
            I act scary, Mike,
            but most of the time
            I'm terrified.
            How come you never
            told me that before?
            Because
            we weren't friends before.
            Check the lake!
            I heard something here!
            This way!
            I saw movement!
            Over there!
            Sulley!
            He's cornered!
            No!
            They're still in there!
            Until the authorities arrive,
            this door stays off!
            No! You can't
            do that! No!
            Enough! I want
            this room cleared now!
            You can't do this!
            We got to get out of here!
            Let them come.
            What?
            If we scare them,
            I mean really scare them,
            we could generate enough scream
            to power the door
            from this side!
            What are you talking about?
            I have read every book
            about Scaring ever written.
            This could work!
            They're adults.
            I can't do this.
            Yes, you can.
            Just follow my lead.
            Mama!
            Mama!
            Mama...
            What the...
            Now what?
            Phase two.
            Keep together.
            Are you ready?
            Mike, I can't.
            Yes, you can.
            Stop being a Sullivan
            and start being you.
            Call for backup.
            Assistance on the north side.
            Repeat, we need assistance
            on the north side.
            Ranger,
            answer me, what's your 20?
            We need assistance on the north side.
            We have a...
            Look! What was it?
            Let's go.
            Sulley, come on!
            How?
            How did you do this?
            Don't ask me.
            Move, move, move!
            This is a 54-23 in progress.
            All right,
            everybody, clear out.
            Secure the perimeter.
            No child breach.
            Repeat: No child breach.
            You ruined our doors!
            I've been working on
            my door all semester!
            Let's go, you two.
            You're alive!
            We are so glad you're safe.
            Hey, wait!
            What's going to happen to them?
            That's for the
            university president to decide.
            But you can be sure we'll
            be watching these two.
            Always watching.
            Expelled?
            Yeah, we really messed up.
            So, you're leaving?
            Yeah, buddy. We have to go.
            Harsh, man.
            I'm sorry, guys.
            You'd be in the Scaring program
            right now if it wasn't for us.
            What?
            Well, it is
            the gosh-darnedest thing.
            Hardscrabble's letting us
            into the Scare program.
            What?
            She was impressed with our
            performance in the games.
            She invited us to
            join next semester!
            Congratulations, guys!
            And that's not the
            only piece of good news.
            Sherrie and I are engaged!
            Oh. Who is Sherrie?
            She's my mom.
            Well, if it isn't my
            two favorite fellas!
            Come here.
            Give me some sugar.
            Oh!
            Ugh! So uncomfortable.
            Oh, come on, Scott.
            I don't want you to think
            of me as your new dad.
            After all,
            we're fraternity brothers first.
            This is so weird.
            Just think of me
            as your big brother
            that's marrying your mother.
            Wait. Hold on.
            We're brothers who share
            the same mom slash wife.
            That's worse.
            Well, I guess
            we should be going now.
            Promise me
            you'll keep in touch.
            You're the scariest bunch
            of monsters I have ever met.
            Don't let anyone
            tell you different.
            So, what now?
            You know, for the first time in my life,
            I don't really have a plan.
            You're the great Mike Wazowski.
            You'll come up with something.
            I think it's time I leave the
            greatness to other monsters.
            I'm okay just being okay.
            So long, Sull.
            So long.
            Wazowski!
            Whoa!
            Stop the bus!
            Are you crazy?
            Mike,
            I don't know a single Scarer
            who can do what you do.
            I know,
            everyone sees us together,
            they think I'm the one running the show,
            but the truth is,
            I've been riding your
            coattails since day one!
            You made the deal
            with Hardscrabble.
            You took a hopeless team
            and made them champions.
            All I did was catch a pig!
            Technically, I caught the pig.
            Exactly! And you
            think you're just okay?
            You pulled off the biggest Scare
            this school has ever seen!
            That wasn't me!
            That was you!
            You think I could have
            done that without you?
            I didn't even bring a pencil
            on the first day of school.
            Mike, you're not scary.
            Not even a little.
            But you are fearless.
            And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
            then she can just...
            I can just what?
            Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
            I was just warming up to you.
            Sorry.
            Well, gentlemen,
            it seems you made
            the front page again.
            The two of you did
            something together
            that no one has
            ever done before.
            You surprised me.
            Perhaps I should keep an
            eye out for more surprises
            like you in my program.
            But as far as the two
            of you are concerned
            there is nothing
            I can do for you now.
            Except, perhaps, wish you luck.
            And, Mr. Wazowski,
            keep surprising people.
            You know,
            there is still one way
            we can work at a Scare company.
            They're always
            hiring in the mailroom.
            This is better
            than I ever imagined!
            I bet we break the all-time
            record in our first year.
            Mike, we're mail guys.
            I know. I'm talking about the
            record for letters delivered!
            All right, newbies,
            quit goofing around.
            I'll have you know tampering
            with the mail is a crime
            punishable by banishment!
            Yes, sir.
            We're right on it,
            Mr. Snowman.

            Uh... my friends
            call me Phlegm.
            Uh-huh.
            Mr Bile, can you tell me
            what you did wrong?
            I fell down?
            No, no, before that.
            Can anyone tell me
            Mr Bile's big mistake?
            Anyone?
            ( coughs )

            Let's take a look

            puh-puh-puh-puh...
            Ah! There, see?
            The door.
            You left it wide open.
            ( whiopers )
            ( all ourouring )
            And leaving the door open
            is the worst mistake
            any employee
            can make because...?
            Um... it could let in a draft?
            It could let in
            a child!
            Oh! Mr Waternoose!
            There is nothing more toxic
            or deadly than a human child.
            A single touch could kill you!
            Leave a door open
            and a child could walk
            right into this factory!
            Right into the monster world!
            I won't go
            in a kid's room!
            You can't make me!
            You're going in there
            because we need this.

            Our city is counting on you
            to collect
            those children's screams.
            Without scream,
            we have no power.
            Yes, it's dangerous work
            and that's why I need
            you to be at your best.
            I need scarers
            who are confident, tenacious
            tough, intimidating.
            I need scarers like... like...

            Hey! Good morning,
            Monstropolis.
            It's now five after
            the hour of 6:00 a.m.
            in the big monster city.
            Temperature's a
            balmy 65 degrees--
            which is good news
            for you reptiles--
            and it looks like it's
            going to be a perfect day
            to maybe, hey,
            just lie in bed, sleep in
            or simply... work out that flab
            that's hanging over the bed!
            Get up, Sulley!
            -( honking )
            -( screaoing )
            I don't believe I ordered
            a wake-up call, Mikey.
            Hey! Less talk, more pain,
            marshmallow boy!
            -( growling )

            a monster?

            Scary feet, scary feet,
            scary feet!
            Oop! The kid's awake!
            Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
            scary feet, scary feet--
            Kid's asleep!
            ( roaring )
            Twins! In a bunk bed!
            ( growling )
            Ooh! I thought I had you there.
            Okay, Sulley, here we go.
            You ready? Follow it.
            Oh! It's over here!
            Oh, look over there!
            Don't let the kid
            touch you!
            Don't let it touch you!
            I don't know,
            but it's been said
            I love scaring kids in bed!

            breaking a sweat.

            ( phone rings )
            Hello.
            I know!
            Hey, wasn't I great?
            Did the whole
            family see it?
            It's your mom.
            What can I say?
            The camera loves me.
            ( bicycle bell rings )
            I'm telling you, big daddy
            you're going to be seeing
            this face on TV a lot more often.
            ~Yeah? Like, on
            Monstropolis's Most Wanted?

            You've been jealous
            of my good looks
            since the
            fourth grade, pal.
            Have a good day, sweetie.
            You, too, hon.
            Whoo!
            Okay, Sulley, hop on in.
            Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
            Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
            Where you going?
            What are you doing?
            Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
            We're walking.
            Walking?! Yep.
            No, no, no, my baby.
            Come on. Come on.
            Look, she needs
            to be driven.
            Bye, baby.
            I... I'll call you!
            MIKE:
            Hey, genius,
            you want to know why
            I bought the car? Huh?
            Not really.
            To drive it!
            You know, like,
            on the street?
            With the honk-honk
            and the vroom-vroom
            and no walking involved.
            ( oock whining )
            Give it a rest,
            will you, butterball?
            Come on, you could
            use the exercise.
            I could use
            the exercise?!
            Look at you.
            You have your own climate!

            Ah, just trying
            to make sure
            there's enough scream
            to go around.
            ( laughing )
            Hey! On the house!
            -Hey, thanks!
            -Grazie!

            Harryhausen's?!
            But it's impossible to
            get a reservation there!
            Not for Googley Bear.
            I will see you
            at quitting time
            and not a minute later.
            Okay, sweetheart.

            Oh, and, uh,
            thanks for hooking me up
            with those reservations.
            Oh, no problem.
            They're under the
            name Googley Bear.
            Oh, good ide...
            You know,
            that wasn't very funny.

            ( chuckling )
            What do you know?
            It scares little kids
            and little monsters.
            I wasn't scared.
            I have... allergies.
            ( coughing )
            Uh-huh. Sure.
            Hey, Randall, save it for

            Wow, Randall.
            That's great.
            That should make it
            even more humiliating
            when we break the record first.
            Ha, ha!
            Shh, shh, shh,
            shh, shh.
            Do you hear that?
            It's the winds of change.
            ( oocking voice ):
            ''You hear it?
            You hear the winds of ch...?''
            Oh, what a creep.
            One of these days,
            I am really...
            going to let you
            teach that guy a lesson.

            MIKE:
            Good morning, Roz
            my succulent
            little garden snail.
            And who would
            we be scaring today?
            Wazowski, you didn't file
            your paperwork last night.
            Oh, that darn paperwork.
            Wouldn't it be easier
            if it all just blew away?
            ( chair squeaking )
            Don't let it happen again.
            Yes, well, I'll, uh...
            I'll try to be less careless.
            I'm watching you, Wazowski.
            Always watching.
            Whoo! She's nuts.
            Always!

            We got scarers coming out!

            the best monster win.
            I plan to.

            You're the boss.
            You're the boss.
            You're the big,

            ( bell dings )
            Oh, I'm feeling
            good today, Mikey!

            Whoa!
            Attaboy.
            Attaboy.
            Another door coming right up.

            You're still behind,
            Randall.
            You know, maybe I should
            realign the scream intake valve.
            Just get me
            another door!
            A door! Yes, door!

            ( children screaoing )
            Well,Jerry, what's
            the damage so far?
            We may actually
            make our quota today, sir.
            Hmm. First time
            in a month.
            ( gurgling and burping )
            Huh?!
            ( door buzzing )
            ( screaoing and sobbing )
            What happened?
            The kid almost
            touched me!
            She got this close
            to me!
            She wasn't
            scared of you?
            She was only six!
            I could've been dead!
            I could've died!
            Keep it together, man.
            ( whistling )
            Hey! We got a dead
            door over here!
            -We're coming!
            -Coming!
            -Look out!
            -Out of the way!
            -Coming through!
            -Excuse us.
            ( whiopering )
            We've lost 58 doors
            this week, sir.
            Oh, kids these days.
            They just don't get
            scared like they used to.
            Let her rip!

            Hey! Watch it!
            ( Sulley laughing )
            Well,James, that was
            an impressive display!
            Oh, just doing my job,
            Mr Waternoose.
            Of course, I did
            learn from the best.
            ( both laughing )
            If I don't see a new door at
            my station in five seconds
            I will personally
            put you through the shredder!
            ( screaos )
            Hey, Wazowski, nice job!
            Those numbers
            are pretty sweet.
            Are they?
            You know,
            I hadn't even noticed.
            And, uh...
            how is Georgie doing?
            He's doing great!
            I love working
            with that big guy.
            ( child screaoing )
            Keep the doors coming,
            Charlie.
            I'm on a roll today.
            George and I

            JERRY:
            Okay, people, take a break!
            We got to shut down
            for a half-hour
            and reset the system.
            An entire scare floor
            out of commission.
            What else can go wrong?
            Oh... what a day.
            We're just going through
            a rough time, sir.
            Everyone knows you're going
            to get us through it.
            Tell that to the
            board of directors.
            ( slurping )
            James, this company
            has been in my family
            for three generations.
            I would do anything to
            keep it from going under.
            Oh, so would I, sir.
            Well...
            Say, I could use your help
            with something.
            Anything, sir.
            You see, we've hired
            some new scare recruits
            and frankly, they're...
            they're, um... uh...
            Inexperienced?
            Oh, they stink!
            Uh-huh.
            And I thought maybe
            you might come by tomorrow
            and give them a demonstration.
            Show them what it takes
            to be a top scarer, huh?
            I'll start out with the old
            Waternoose jump-and-growl.
            ( growling loudly )
            Ha! Oh, oh, yes!
            Now, that's my boy!
            ( both laughing )
            ( ringing )
            JERRY:
            Let's go, everybody!
            All doors must be returned!
            No exceptions!
            -Whoo!
            -Oh, yeah.
            I've never seen anything
            like you today.
            You were on
            a roll, my man.
            Another day like this
            and that scare record's
            in the bag.
            That's right, baby!
            Uh-huh.
            So get this--
            as if dinner wasn't enough
            I'm taking her to
            a monster truck rally afterwards.
            Nice.
            What's on your agenda?
            I'm going to head home
            and work out some more.
            Again? You know, there's
            more to life than scaring.
            ( sniffing )
            Whew. Hey, can I
            borrow your odorant?
            Yeah. I got, uh...
            smelly garbage or old dumpster.
            You got low tide?
            No.
            How about wet dog?
            Yep. Stink it up.
            ( growling )
            You know, I am so romantic
            sometimes I think
            I should just marry myself.
            Give me a break,
            Mike.
            What a night of romance
            I got ahead of me.
            Tonight is about me
            and Celia.
            Ooh, the love boat
            is about to set sail.
            ( ioitating ship horn )
            'Cause I got
            to tell you, buddy
            that face of hers,
            it just makes my heart go...
            Yikes!
            Hello, Wazowski.
            Fun-filled evening
            planned for tonight?
            Well, as a
            matter of fact...
            Then I'm sure you
            filed your paperwork
            correctly... for once.
            Your stunned silence
            is very reassuring.
            Oh, no. My scare reports--
            I left them on my desk
            and if I'm not at
            the restaurant in five minutes
            they're going to give
            our table away!
            What am I going to tell...
            Schmoopsie-poo.
            Hey, Googley Bear.
            Want to get going?
            Do I ever!
            It's just that...
            What?
            Uh, you know,
            there's a small....
            I don't understand.
            It's just that I forgot
            about some paperwork
            I was supposed to file.
            Mike was reminding me.
            Thanks, buddy.
            Whoo.
            I was? I mean, I was!
            Yeah, I was.
            Oh, okay.
            Let's go then.
            We're going!
            On my desk, Sulley.
            The pink copies
            go to Accounting
            the fuchsia ones
            go to Purchasing
            and goldenrod ones
            go to Roz.
            Huh!
            Leave the puce.
            SULLEY:
            Pink copies go to Accounting,
            the fuchsia ones go to Roz.
            No, fuchsia ones
            go to Purchasing.
            The goldenrod ones go to Roz.
            Man, I have no idea
            what puce is.
            Oh, that's puce.
            Hmm?
            Uh, hello?
            Anyone?
            There's a door here.

            ALL:
            Get a paper bag!
            Mmm.
            ( laughing )
            Oh, Michael, I've had
            a lot of birthday...
            well, not a
            lot of birthdays
            but this is the
            best birthday ever.
            Hmm.
            What are you
            looking at?
            I was just thinking
            about the first time
            I laid eye on you--
            how pretty you looked.
            Stop it!
            Your hair was
            shorter then.
            Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
            about getting it cut.
            ( faint squeal of fear )
            No, no, I like
            it this length.
            ( sighs of relief )
            I like everything
            about you.
            Just the other day
            someone asked me
            who I thought
            the most beautiful monster was
            in all of Monstropolis.
            You know what I said?
            What did you say?
            I said...
            Sulley?
            Sulley?
            No! No, no.
            That's not
            what I was going to say.
            Mike, you're not making sense.
            SULLEY:
            Hi, guys!
            What a coincidence,
            running into you here!
            Uh, I'm just going
            to order something to go.
            Michael...
            Sulley!
            I wonder what's good here.
            Get out of here.
            You're ruining everything.
            I went back to get
            your paperwork
            and there was a door.
            What?
            ( rattling )
            A door?!
            Randall was in it.
            Wait a minute.
            Randall?
            That cheater!
            He's trying
            to boost his numbers!
            There's something else.
            What?!
            Ook-lay in the ag-bay.
            What?!
            Look in the bag.
            What bag?
            ( sighs )
            ( gasps )
            ( giggling )
            Oh!
            They don't have
            anything I like here.
            So take care, Celia!
            Excuse me, sir.
            What's going on?
            Celia, please try
            to understand.
            I have to do something!

            A kid!
            There's a kid here--
            a human kid!

            Well, I don't think that date
            could have gone any worse.
            ( explosion )
            ( electrical buzzing )
            If witnesses are to be believed
            there has been
            a child security breach
            for the first time
            in monster history.
            We can neither confirm nor deny
            the presence of
            a human child here tonight.
            Well, a kid flew right over me
            and blasted a car
            with its laser vision!
            I tried to run from it,
            but it picked me up
            with its mind powers
            and shook me like a doll!
            It's true!
            I saw the whole thing!
            It is my
            professional opinion
            that now is the time
            to... panic!
            Oh-oh.
            ( both yelling )
            Oh, it's coming!
            It's coming!

            Come here, kid.
            Whee.
            No, don't touch those,
            you little...!
            Oh, now
            those were alphabetized.
            It's okay, it's all right.
            As long as it doesn't
            come near us
            we're going to be okay.

            Mike, give her the bear.

            Make it stop!
            Look!
            See the bear?
            Ooh, nice bear.
            ( screaos )
            Sulley!
            See?
            Ooh, bear, ooh.
            Oh, he's
            a happy bear.
            He's not crying,
            neither should you
            Or we'll be in trouble
            'Cause they're gonna find us
            So please stop crying
            Right now.
            Good, good, Sulley.
            Keep it up.
            You're doing great.
            Ooh, the happy bear,
            he has no...
            ( screaoing )
            She touched me!
            Sulley, the bear!
            The bear!
            Give her the...
            Whoa!

            What was that?
            ( thuoping )
            I have no idea
            but it would be
            really great
            if it didn't
            do it again.
            ( giggles )
            Shh, shh, shh.
            Shh...
            Shh.
            Shh...
            Ah!
            How could I do this?
            How could I be so stupid?
            This could destroy
            the company.
            The company?
            Who cares
            about the company?!
            What about us?
            That thing is
            a killing machine!
            La-la-la-la-la-la
            I bet it's just waiting
            for us to fall asleep
            and then wham!
            Oh, we're easy prey,
            my friend-- easy prey.
            We're sitting targets.
            Okay, look, I think
            I have a plan here.
            Using mainly spoons, we dig
            a tunnel under the city
            and release it into the wild.
            Spoons.
            That's it, I'm out of ideas.
            We're closed.
            Hot air balloon?
            Too expensive.
            Giant slingshot?
            Too conspicuous.
            Enormous wooden horse?
            Too Greek!
            ( speaking baby talk )
            No plan. No plan.
            Can't think.
            Can't think.
            Flatlining.
            Uh, Mike?
            I think she's getting tired.
            Well, then
            why don't you
            find someplace
            for it to sleep?
            While I think of a plan!
            Are you sleepy?
            You want to sleep?
            Is that what you want?
            Huh?
            ( crunching )
            Okay, all right.
            I'm making a nice
            little area for you to...
            ( giggling )
            No. Hey, hey,
            that's my bed!
            You're going to get
            your germs all over it.
            ( sighing ):
            Fine.
            My chair is
            more comfortable anyway.
            ( yells )
            What?
            ( speaking fearfully )
            It's just a closet.
            Will you go to sleep?
            Hey, that looks like Randall.
            Randall's your monster.
            You think he's going
            to come through the closet
            and scare you.
            Oh, boy,
            how do I explain this?
            Uh, it's empty.
            -See?
            -Ah!
            No monster in here.
            Well, now there is
            but I'm not going to scare you.
            I'm off-duty.
            Okay.
            How about I sit here,
            until you fall asleep?
            Go ahead.
            Go to sleep.
            Now.
            Now... go.
            Uh, you...
            go...
            to...
            sleep.
            ( ioitating snoring )
            ( giggles )
            ( sighs in relief )
            ( door creaks softly )
            Hey, Mike,
            this might sound crazy
            but I don't think
            that kid's dangerous.
            Really? Well, in that case,
            let's keep it.
            I always wanted a pet
            that could kill me!
            Now, look.
            What if we just put
            her back in her door?
            What?
            Mike, think about it.
            If we send her back,
            it's like it never happened.
            Everything goes back to normal.
            Is that a joke?
            Tell me you're joking.
            Sulley, I'd like to think
            that, given the circumstances
            I have been extremely
            forgiving up to now
            but that is a horrible idea!
            What are we going to do?
            March right out into
            public with that thing?
            Then I guess we just waltz
            right up to the factory, right?
            I can't believe we
            are waltzing right
            up to the factory.
            Sulley, a mop,
            a couple of lights
            and some chair fabric
            are not going
            to fool anyone!
            Just think about
            a few names, will you?
            Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
            the Abominable Snowman--
            they all got one thing
            in common, pal-- banishment.
            We could be next!
            Don't panic--
            we can do this.
            Hey, how you doing, Frank?
            Hey, guys.
            Everything's going
            to be okay.
            ( gasping )
            ( equipoent buzzing loudly )
            Number One wants this place
            dusted for prints.
            Careful with that.
            I got a good view from here.
            A little lower.
            This was recovered
            at the scene.
            Don't panic.
            Don't panic!
            Don't tell me
            not to panic.
            Just keep it together.
            Everything is not okay!
            LITTLE GIRL:
            Boo.
            ...could be contaminated.
            Gentlemen, safety
            is our number one concern.
            If there's anything that...
            Not now, not now.
            Oh, hello, little one.
            Where did you come from?
            Mr Waternoose!
            Ah,James!
            Is this one yours?
            Actually, that's my, uh,
            cousin's sister's daughter, sir.
            Yeah, it's, uh...
            ''Bring an Obscure Relative
            to Work Day.''
            Hmm, must have
            missed the memo.
            Well, listen,James
            why don't you stop by
            the simulator after lunch today
            and give us
            that scare demonstration
            we talked about, huh?
            Oh, oh, sir, uh....
            Excuse me,
            Mr Waternoose?
            Yes, yes, I'm coming.
            All right then, I'll see
            you this afternoon,James.
            That is, if these gentlemen
            haven't shut us down.
            Oh, boy.
            Oh, a scare demo.
            Well, that is great.
            Why am I
            the last to know?
            We can bring your cousin's
            sister's daughter along.
            She'll be a big hit!
            ( equipoent buzzing loudly )
            Halt!
            ( yelling )
            Stop him!
            Hold him down.
            Come on,
            the coast is clear.
            Okay, all we have to do
            is get rid of that thing.
            So, wait here while
            I get its card key.
            But she can't stay here.
            This is the men's room.
            That is the weirdest thing
            you have ever said.
            It's fine. It's okay.
            Look, it loves it here!
            It's dancing with joy!
            Uh, uh, uh, uh.
            I'll be right back
            with its door key.
            ( laughs )
            That's a cute little
            dance you've got.
            It almost looks
            like you've got to...
            ( whining )
            Oh.
            ( singing in baby talk )
            ( singing stops )
            Uh, are you
            done in there?
            ( squeals )
            Ah! Sorry. Sorry.
            ( singing )
            ( toilet flushes )
            Okay, you
            finished now, right?
            Hello?
            ( yells )
            Boo.
            ( giggles )
            ( sighs )
            ( giggling )
            ( chuckles )
            Where did she go?
            Oh, did she disappear?
            Did she turn invisible?
            ( giggling softly )
            I just have no idea.
            Gotcha!
            Boo.
            ( giggles )
            Hey, you're good.
            ( sighs )
            Be relaxed,
            be relaxed, be relaxed.
            Roz, my tender,
            oozing blossom
            you're looking
            fabulous today.
            Is that a new haircut?
            Come on, tell me.
            It's a new haircut,
            isn't it?
            That's got to be
            a new haircut.
            New make-up?
            You've had a lift.
            You've had a tuck.
            You've had something.
            Something has been
            inserted in your skin
            that makes you look like...
            ( sighs )
            Listen, I need a favour.
            Randall was working
            late last night
            out on the scare floor.
            I really need the key
            for the door he was using.
            Well, isn't that nice?
            But guess what?
            You didn't turn in
            your paperwork last night.
            He didn't... I...
            no paperwork?
            This office is now closed.
            ( Mike screaos in pain )
            Ready or not, here I come!
            I'm getting warmer.
            Any second now.
            Fee fi fo...
            What are you doing?!
            I-I'm looking
            for the kid.
            You lost it?!
            No, no, she was just....
            ( squeals )
            Here she is.
            ( whining )
            Hey, what's the matter?
            RAND ALL:
            I already told your buddies
            I haven't seen anything.
            CD A AGENT:
            All right. Carry on.
            ( splashing )
            Randall!
            Thank goodness!
            What are we going to do
            about the child?
            Shh!
            Shh, shh, shh.
            ( door slaos open )
            ( door slaos open )
            The front page!
            It's on the front page.
            The child--
            the one you were after.
            Will you be quiet?!
            Don't you think I'm aware
            of the situation?
            I was up all night
            trying to find it.
            I did a simple
            calculation
            factoring in the size
            of the sushi restaurant.
            The child
            may have escaped!
            Yeah, well, until
            we know for sure
            we're going to act like
            nothing happened, understand?
            You just get the
            machine up and running.
            I'll take care of the kid.
            And when I find whoever
            let it out, they're dead!
            Oh!
            Why are you still here?
            Come on, go!
            Move! Now!
            FUNGUS:
            Ow, ow! I'm not here.
            SULLEY ( whispering ):
            They're gone.
            ( squeaking and splashing )
            LITTLE GIRL:
            Ew.
            MIKE:
            This is bad.
            This is so very bad.
            What were they talking
            about a machine?
            Who cares? Oh!
            Look, don't panic--
            all we have to do
            is call her door down
            and send her home.
            You're right.
            You're right.
            We're just two regular joes
            on our way to work.
            We will blend right in.
            Top of the mornin', fellas!
            Hey, what's shakin',
            bacon?
            Did you lose weight?
            Or a limb?
            You have
            her card key, right?
            Of course
            I have her card key.
            I told you
            I'd get her card key.
            I went and got
            her card key
            and now I have her card key.
            Okay, here we go.
            Take care of yourself.
            Try not to run
            through any more closets.
            ( giggles )
            Mike,
            that's not her door.
            What are you
            talking about?
            Of course it's her door.
            It's her door.
            No, her door was white
            and it had flowers on it.
            No. It must have been
            dark last night
            because this is its door.
            ( polka ousic playing )
            Hey, you hear that?
            Sounds like fun in there!
            Okay, send me a postcard, kid.
            That's Mike Wazowski, care of
            you-got-your-life-back Lane.
            Mowki Kowski.
            Very good.
            Now bon voyage!
            Bye-bye!
            Come on.
            Look at the stick.
            See the stick?
            Go get the stick!
            Go fetch.
            Mike, this isn't
            Boo's door.
            Boo? What's Boo?
            That's what I decided
            to call her.
            Is there a problem?
            Sulley, you're not
            supposed to name it.
            Once you name it,
            you start getting attached to it!
            Now put that thing
            back where it came from,
            or so help me...
            Oh, hey!
            We're rehearsing a scene
            for the upcoming company play
            ~called Put That Thing
            Back Where It Caoe Froo
            Or So Help Me.
            ( Mike laughing )
            It's a musical!
            Put that thing back where
            it came from or so help me
            Bom-bom, bom-bom,
            bom-bom...
            So help me,
            so help me.
            And cut!
            We're still working on it.
            It's a work in progress
            but, hey,
            we need ushers.
            Sulley, I've had enough.
            Now say goodbye to...
            where'd it go?
            What'd you do with it?
            ( gasps ):
            Where is she?
            I don't believe it.
            She got away
            from you again?!
            Well, that is just...
            Wait a minute.
            The sun is coming up.
            This is perfect!
            She's gone!
            Hey, hey, hey, hey.
            Where are you going?
            Sulley, please,
            don't blow this.
            Not when we're so close
            to breaking the record.
            Somebody else
            will find the kid.
            It'll be their problem,
            not ours!
            She's out of our hair!
            What are you
            two doing?
            They're rehearsing a play.
            She's out of our hair!
            Can it, Wazowski!
            So, what do you think
            of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
            Pretty crazy, huh?
            Oh, yeah, crazy.
            Word on the street is the kid's
            been traced back
            to this factory.
            You haven't seen anything,
            have you?
            Uh, well, uh...
            No, no way!
            But if it was
            an inside job
            I'd put my money
            on Waxford.
            Waxford?
            Yeah, the one
            at station six.
            You know, he's got
            them shifty eyes.
            Hey, Waxford!
            Sulley!
            CELIA:
            Michael Wazowski!
            ( whiopers )
            Last night was one
            of the worst nights
            of my entire life,
            bar none!
            ( hissing )
            I thought
            you cared about me.
            Honey, please.
            Schmoopsie, I thought
            you liked sushi.
            CELIA:
            Sushi? Sushi?!!
            You think this is
            about sushi?!
            Wazowski!
            Michael! Mike...
            Men.
            ( panting )
            Breathe. Keep breathing.
            Whew.
            Yikes!
            Where's the kid?
            Kid? What kid?
            It's here in
            the factory, isn't it?
            You're not
            pinning this on me.
            It never would
            have gotten out
            if you hadn't been
            cheating last night!
            Cheating?
            Cheating. Right.
            Okay, I think I know how
            to make this all go away.
            What happens when
            the whistle blows
            in five minutes?
            Uh... I get a time-out?
            Everyone goes to lunch!
            Which means the scare floor
            will be...?
            Painted?
            Empty! It'll be
            empty, you idiot!
            You see that clock?
            When the big hand
            is pointing up
            and the little hand
            is pointing up
            the kid's door
            will be in my station.
            But when the big hand
            points down
            the door will be gone.
            You have until then
            to put the kid back.
            Get the picture?
            ( roaring playfully )
            Boo!
            ( giggles )
            No.
            Hey, you! Halt!
            He's the one.
            The one from
            the commercial!
            Affirmative.
            That's him.
            Can we get
            an autograph?
            Oh, oh, sure.
            No problem.
            You can make that out
            to Bethany, my daughter.
            Yes. Let's see....
            ''From your scary friend
            best wishes...''
            So I said,
            ''If you talk to me
            like that again,
            we're through!''
            What'd she say?
            You know my mom.
            She sent me to my room.
            See you guys later.
            Take it easy.
            Bottoms up!
            ( gasps in horror )
            No!
            ( singing )
            Whoa!
            Hey.
            ( growling )
            Oh, well, hello, there.
            What's your name?
            Mike Wazowski!
            ( oachinery pounding loudly )
            ( grinding and chopping )
            ( panting )
            ( ooans )
            Sulley!
            Oh, Sulley.
            Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.
            Hey, you guys seen
            Sulley anywhere?
            Nope. Sorry.
            Oh, Sulley!
            Boy, Wazowski looks
            like he's in trouble.
            ( squeaking and quacking )
            We have a 231 9!
            Oh, dear.
            Get him!
            Sulley?
            Sulley!
            ( ooaning )
            Sulley!
            Oh, great news, pal.
            I got us a way out of this mess
            but we got to hurry.
            Where is it?
            ( whiopering )
            Sull, that's
            a cube of garbage.
            ( squeaks )
            Uh-oh.
            I-I can still hear
            her little voice.
            BOO:
            Mike Wazowski!
            Hey, I can hear her, too.
            BABY MONSTERS:
            Mike Wazowski!
            How many kids
            you got in there?
            Mike Wazowski!
            Kitty!
            Boo!
            Boo, oh,
            you're all right!
            I was so worried!
            Don't you ever run away
            from me again, young lady!
            Oh, but I'm so glad
            you're safe.
            My, what an affectionate father.
            Actually, she's
            my cousin's sister's...
            Okay, Sulley.
            That's enough.
            Let's go.
            Mike Wazowski!
            Yeah, yeah.
            Step aside, kid.
            We're in a...
            ( screaos in pain )
            ( screaos with laughter )
            ( electrical buzzing )
            ( light bulbs shattering )
            ( gasping )
            ( baby oonsters screaoing
            ~ and crying )
            Will you stop
            making Boo laugh?
            I didn't, so come on!
            ( screaoing and crying
            ~ continue )
            I still don't understand.
            You've got Boo's door?
            I'll explain later.
            Run.
            Okay, let's move,
            let's move, let's move.
            Come on.
            Oh, please be there, please
            be there, please be there.
            There it is!
            Just like Randall said!
            Randall?
            Wait a minute.
            ( cries out in fear )
            Oh, hey.
            One, two, three, four!
            Get the kid back
            through the door!
            Hey, hey.
            We're going to get
            our lives back.
            The nightmare is over.
            Hey, it's okay, Boo.
            What's the matter?
            Come on, it's time to move!
            Mike, what are you thinking?
            We can't trust Randall.
            He's after Boo.
            Who cares?
            Let's go.
            This is a limited time offer.
            No, no.
            I don't like this.
            Look, Sulley, you wanted
            her door and there it is.
            Now, let's move.
            No, Mike.
            ( sighs ):
            You want me to prove
            everything's on the up-and-up?
            Fine! He wants the door,
            I get the door...
            ( whispering ):
            Mike, wait!
            He's a paranoid
            delusional furball.
            Mike!
            ( whiopers in fear )
            ( whining )
            Shh, shh, shh.
            ( soall cry of surprise )
            ( lunch bell rings )
            Hey, Sulley,
            where you been all day?
            Sulley? Sulley?
            Huh?
            ( whispering ):
            Mike?
            Mike?
            Where are you?
            You in there?
            Where are you, buddy?
            Mike?
            Hey.
            ( door thunks )
            ( excited baby talk )
            Boo, way to go.
            ( giggles )
            It's okay.
            ( door clunks shut )
            ( pipes whistling and venting )
            ( distant voices )
            RAND ALL:
            Yes! I got the kid!
            FUNGUS:
            Oh, huzzah!
            That's great news.
            Not that I was concerned,
            of course.
            Just get over
            here and help me!
            Come on, come
            on, come on.
            While we're young
            here, Fungus!
            ( both straining )
            Kid needs to take
            off a few pounds.
            ( yelps )
            Wazowski?!
            Where is it,
            you little one-eyed cretin?
            Okay, first of all,
            it's cree-tin.
            If you're going
            to threaten me
            do it properly.
            Second of all, you're nuts
            if you think kidnapping me
            is going to help you cheat
            your way to the top!
            ( chuckling evilly )
            You still think this is about
            that stupid scare record?
            Well... I did, right up
            until you chuckled like that
            and now I'm thinking
            I should just get out of here.
            I am about to revolutionise
            the scaring industry
            and when I do, even
            the great James P. Sullivan
            is going to be
            working for me.
            MIKE:
            Well
            somebody's certainly
            been a busy bee.
            First, I need to know
            where the kid is
            and you're going
            to tell me.
            Yeah, I don't
            know anything.
            Uh-huh, sure.
            MIKE:
            I don't.
            I mean, I don't.
            Uh-oh.
            ( oechanical clanging
            ~ and grinding )
            What's that?
            Come on.
            Wait, wait, wait.
            Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
            Oh, come on.
            No, no, no, no, no.
            Come on,
            hey, hey, hey.
            This thing is moving.
            I don't like big...
            moving things that are
            moving towards me.
            No! Come on!
            Hey, Randall!
            Say hello
            to the scream extractor.
            Hello.
            Come on,
            where you going?
            We'll talk.
            Come on,
            we'll have a latte!
            Come on.
            We can talk
            about this.
            ( electrical whirring starts,
            ~ then grows louder )
            What's that thing?
            What is that thing?
            Wait, wait, wait!
            Stop, stop!
            No, no!
            Come on, hey!
            ( deep, resonating whirring )
            Help! Help! Help!
            Help!
            ( yelling )
            ( noise dies away )
            Oh, for...
            What did you
            do wrong this time?
            I don't know.
            I calibrated the drive...
            Go check the machine!
            There must be something wrong
            with the scream intake valve.
            That's the problem
            with these 3250 units...
            Huh?
            Hmm.
            Psst!
            Fungus.
            Fungus.
            You like cars, huh?
            'Cause I got a really nice car.
            If you let me go,
            I'll give you...
            a ride in the car.
            Please, Fungus?
            I'm sorry, Wazowski,
            but Randall said
            I'm not allowed to fraternize
            with victims of his evil plot.
            ( gasps )
            ( clanging )
            Hmm...
            ( zapping )
            ( electrical whirring )
            ( clanking, rattling, whirring )
            ( gasps )
            ( ouffled screaos )
            What happened?
            Where's Wazowski?
            ( ouffled screaos )
            ( shuts off oachine )
            Where is he?!
            ( whiopering )
            ( growls )
            ( whiopering )
            ( squeals )
            Come on!
            This is crazy.
            He's going to kill us!
            CD A AGENT:
            Careful.
            That could be contaminated.
            We got to get out of here now!
            We can start a whole new life
            somewhere far away.
            Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.!
            Goodbye, Mr Waternoose!
            No, Mike, wait!
            Hey, what are you doing?
            Follow me. I have an idea.
            No! No, no, no, no,
            no, no, no, no...
            COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
            Simulation terminated.
            WATERNOOSE:
            No, no, no, no, no.
            What was that?
            You're trying to scare the kid,
            not lull it to sleep.
            I was going for a
            snake/ ninja approach
            with a little hissing.
            ( hisses )
            How many times
            do I have to tell you?
            It's all about presence!
            About how you enter the room!
            Mr Waternoose!
            James! Perfect timing.
            No, no. Sir, you
            don't understand.
            Ah, now, show these monsters
            how it's done.
            What? No, no,
            I can't...
            Sir...
            sir, you have
            to listen to me.
            Pay attention, everyone.
            You're about to see
            the best in the business.
            Reset the simulator.
            But-but, sir!
            MOTHER:
            Good night, sweetheart.
            ANIMATRONIC BO Y:
            Night, Mom.
            Kitty!
            No, Boo, no, no!
            Now, give us a big, loud roar.
            Mr Waternoose,
            there's no time for this.
            Come on. What are you
            waiting for? Roar!
            But-but-but, sir!
            Roar!
            ( groans )
            ( roaring ferociously )
            ( shrieking in terror )

            ( Boo crying )
            ( students applauding )
            WATERNOOSE:
            Well done.
            Well done,James.
            Boo?
            -All right, gentlemen,
            I hope you've learned...
            -Right this way, everyone.
            ...a valuable lesson
            in scaring today.
            ( fearful whioper )
            ( whines softly )
            Boo.
            ( nervous grunt )
            ( whining )
            Boo?
            ( panicked grunts )
            ( door slaos )
            Boo, it's me.
            ( squealing )
            ( gasps ):
            The child!
            Sir, she isn't toxic.
            I know it sounds
            crazy, but trust me.
            Boo?
            No, no, no, no.
            It's okay.
            I was just...
            ( whiopering in fear )
            No, no, no, no, no,
            don't be scared.
            That wasn't real.
            It's just a...
            I was just...
            ( crying ):
            No...
            ( Boo continues crying )
            ( Boo sobbing )
            Boo.
            MIKE:
            ...and he was going
            to test it out
            on that sweet,
            little girl.
            Boo.
            Now that we
            have her...
            ...he is trying
            to kill us.
            This whole thing
            is Randall's fault.
            Randall?
            Yes. And we can take
            you to his secret lab,
            which is right here
            in this factory.
            How could this happen?
            Oh, how could this happen?
            Does anyone else
            know about this?
            No, sir.
            Good.
            This company can't afford
            any more bad publicity.
            Now, before we do
            anything else, let's...
            take care of the child.
            Oh, I never thought things
            would come to this...
            not in my factory.
            I'm sorry you boys
            got mixed up in this.
            Especially you,James.
            But now we can set
            everything straight again
            for the good of the company.
            ( whirring )
            ( thunk )
            MIKE:
            Uh...
            sir, that's not her door.
            I know, I know.
            It's yours.
            ( startled gasps )
            ( grunts )
            ( yelling )
            No!
            ( gasps )
            ( voice echoing ):
            Boo!
            ( gasps )
            No! No!
            No! No! No! No!
            No!
            ( desperate grunts )
            It's too late!
            We're banished, genius.
            We're in the human world!
            Oh, what a great idea, going
            to your old pal Waternoose!
            Too bad he was in
            on the whole thing!
            All you had to do was listen
            to me--just once!
            But you didn't, did you?
            You're still not listening!
            ( yelling )
            ( Sulley grunting and groaning )
            Take that!
            ( growling )
            ( gasps in horror )
            Welcome to the Himalayas!
            ( wind gusting )
            ''Abominable''!
            ( chuckles )
            Can you believe that?
            Do I look abominable to you?
            Why can't they call me
            the Adorable Snowman or...
            or the Agreeable Snowman,
            for crying out loud?
            I'm a nice guy.
            Snow cone?
            Yuck.
            No, no, no.
            Don't worry--
            it's lemon.
            Uh, how about
            you, big fella?
            Snow cone?
            Did you see the way she...
            looked at me?
            ( sighs )
            Ah, poor guy.
            I understand.
            It ain't easy
            being banished.
            Take my buddy, Bigfoot.
            When he was banished
            he fashioned an enormous diaper
            out of poison ivy.
            Wore it on his head
            like a tiara.
            Called himself King Itchy.
            Ah, it won't be so hard for
            you guys, though, you know.
            I mean, how lucky
            can you get?
            Banished with your
            best friend.
            He is not my friend.
            Oh. I just assumed you
            were buddies, you know
            when I saw you out
            there in the snow
            hugging and all that.
            Look at that big jerk.
            Ruined my life, and for what?
            A stupid kid!
            Because of you,
            I am now stuck
            in this frozen
            wasteland!
            Wasteland?
            I think you mean wonderland!
            I mean, how about
            all this fabulous snow, huh?
            Oh, and wait till you see
            the local village.
            Cutest thing in the world.
            I haven't even mentioned
            all the free yak's milk.
            What... what did you say?
            Yak's milk.
            Milking a yak
            ain't exactly a picnic.
            You know, once you pick
            the hairs out
            it's very nutritious.
            No, no. Something
            about a village.
            Where?
            Are there kids in it?
            Kids? Sure.
            Tough kids, sissy kids,
            kids who climb on rocks...
            Where is it?!
            It's at the bottom
            of the mountain.
            Around a three-day hike.
            Oh, three days?!
            We need to get there now!
            ( thuop )
            ( ding )
            You want to go to the village?
            Okay, rule number one
            out here.
            Always...
            No.
            Never go out in a blizzard.
            We need to get to Boo.
            ( grunts, then gasps )
            Boo?!
            What about us?
            ( grunts )
            Ever since that kid
            came in
            you've ignored
            everything I've said
            and now look where we are!
            Oh, we were about
            to break the record, Sulley.
            We would have had it made!
            None of that matters now.
            None of it matter...
            Wa-wait a second.
            None of it matters?
            ( sighs )
            MIKE:
            Okay.
            That's.... no. Good. Great.
            So, now the truth
            comes out, doesn't it?
            Oh, would you
            look at that?
            We're out of
            snow cones, uh...
            Let me... just go outside
            and make some more.
            Sulley, what about everything
            we ever worked for?
            Does that matter?
            Huh?
            And what about Celia?
            I am never... never
            going to see her again.
            Doesn't that matter?
            ( sighs )
            What about me?
            I'm your pal.
            I'm... I'm your best friend.
            Don't I matter?
            ( sighs )
            I'm sorry, Mike.
            I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
            I didn't mean
            for this to happen.
            But Boo's in trouble.
            I think there might
            be a way to save her
            if we can just
            get down to that...
            ''We''?
            Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?
            No.
            There's no ''we'' this time, pal.
            I-if-if you want
            to go out there
            and freeze to death
            you be my guest...
            because you're on your own.
            ( wind whistles )
            Hey, I got more snow cones!
            Ohh!
            Ahh!
            Ahh!
            ( yells )
            ( grunting and groaning )
            ( wind howling )
            ( distant child screaoing )
            ( children screaoing )
            Oh, come on, now, George.
            I know you can do this.
            I picked out an easy door
            for you-- in Nepal.
            Nice, quiet Nepal.
            You know, you're right.
            Here, take this.
            Go get 'em, Georgie!
            Gangway! Look out!
            Coming through!
            Sorry, George.
            Hey, you can't just...
            ( gasps )
            ( gagging )
            ( whistling )
            Out of the way!
            -Hey!
            -Whoa!
            Don't!
            ( gasps )
            ( whiopers )
            Finally!
            I never should have
            trusted you with this.
            Because of you, I had
            to banish my top scarer!
            With this machine,
            we won't need scarers.
            Besides, Sullivan got
            what he deserved.
            Sullivan was twice the scarer
            you will ever be!
            ( low growl )
            ( panting )
            ( clanging )
            ( grunting )
            ( yells with effort )
            ( oechanical whirring )
            ( gasps )
            Kitty!
            ( whirring and hissing )
            ( yelling )
            ( shrieking )
            ( roaring )
            Kitty!
            Sullivan?
            ( grunting )
            Wh-whoa!
            Kitty!
            Sorry, Boo.
            Stop him!
            ( growls )
            Let's get you home.
            ( panting )
            ( blow lands )
            Ooh!
            WATERNOOSE:
            Finish him off!
            Oh! Ooh! Oh!
            ( clanging )
            ( thunk )
            You don't know how long
            I've wanted to do
            that, Sullivan.
            ( grunts )
            ( chuckles )
            ( punches landing )
            Hah!
            Ooh!
            ( shrieks )
            ( panting )
            Ooh!
            Mike?!
            Look, it's not that I
            don't care about the kid.
            Mike, you don't
            understand.
            Yes, I do. I was
            just mad, that's all.
            I needed some time to think.
            But you shouldn't
            have left me out there.
            ( thuop )
            I'm being attacked!
            No, I'm not attacking you.
            I'm trying to be honest.
            Just hear me out.
            You and I are a team.
            Nothing is more important
            than our friendship.
            I-I-I know, kid.
            He's too sensitive.
            ( gagging )
            ( whining cry )
            Come on, pal.
            If you start crying,
            I'm going to cry
            and I'll never get through this.
            I'm sorry
            I wasn't there for you
            but I am now.
            Ow!
            Sulley, I am baring
            my soul here.
            The least you could do
            is pay attention!
            ( yells in pain )
            ( sighs in relief )
            Hey, look at that--
            it's Randall! It's...
            Oh.
            Come on!
            WATERNOOSE:
            Get up!
            There can't be
            any witnesses.
            There won't be.
            I'm glad you came back, Mike.
            Somebody's gotta take care
            of you, you big hair ball.
            ( Celia screaoing )
            ( screaoing )
            Ow!
            Schmoopsie-poo,
            I really can't talk.
            Come on!
            Michael, if you
            don't tell me
            what's going on right
            now, we are through!
            You hear me? Through!
            Here's the truth.
            You know the kid that they're
            looking for-- Sulley let her in.
            We tried to
            send her back
            but Waternoose
            had this secret plot
            and now Randall's right behind
            us and he's trying to kill us!
            You expect me to believe that
            pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!
            Mike Wazowski!
            ( startled yell )
            I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!
            RAND ALL:
            Move it! Look out, you...
            Oh!
            ...idiot!
            ( huffing )
            Look out. Coming through,
            here, coming through!
            Make way. Move it!
            Hurry up. Hurry up.
            There they are!
            CELIA: ( over P.A. )
            Attention, employees:
            Randall Boggs
            has just broken
            the all-time scare record.
            Huh?
            No, I didn't.
            Get out of my way!
            ( claoouring )
            Go get 'em, Googley Bear!
            ( Boo shrieks )
            There it is!
            RAND ALL:
            Get off my tail!
            Let me through!
            Sulley,
            what are you doing?
            Grab on, Mike!
            Are you out of your...?
            ( screaoing )
            ( whirring )
            ( Mike whiopering )
            MIKE:
            Sulley, what are we doing?
            We have to get Boo's door
            and find a station.
            MIKE:
            What a plan--
            simple, yet insane!
            ( growls )
            Whoa.
            Oh, boy. ( gasps )
            Hold on!
            ( Mike screaoing )
            ( screaoing )
            ( clinking )
            Wow!
            Don't look down!
            ( teeth chattering )
            ( rattling )
            ( startled gasp )
            ( screaoing )
            ( shrieking )
            I'm gonna be sick.
            I'm gonna be sick!
            Whoa!
            ( screaoing )
            Oh, no!
            ( chugging and clanking )
            No!
            Aah...
            Boo's door?
            There it is!
            MIKE:
            How are we supposed
            to get it now?
            Oh, it's a dead
            end, Sulley!
            ( gasps )
            MIKE:
            There he is.
            Make her laugh.
            What, Sulley?!
            Just do it!
            Oh... ow!
            ( laughing )
            ( squealing laughter )
            ( engines starting )
            SULLEY:
            Get it open.
            Here he comes.
            Give me that kid!
            ( birds twittering )
            ( Boo giggling )
            Why couldn't we
            get banished here?
            Come on. We got to
            find another door.
            ( gasps )
            Look, Boo's door!
            ( grunting )
            There he is!
            Hurry up, hurry up!
            Give me your hand.
            ( screaoing )
            ( grunts )
            Come on, it slides,
            it slides!
            Ooh, right, right, right.
            ( panting )
            ( gasps )
            Jump!
            I'm behind you!
            Come on!
            Hurry up! Keep moving!
            Get inside!
            Ooh! That was weird.
            ( grunts )
            Mike?
            Oh, sorry, buddy.
            ( stunned ouobling )
            ( growls )
            ( electronic whirring )
            Oh!
            I hope that hurt, lizard boy!
            ( laughing )
            Great job, buddy.
            We lost him.
            ( squeals )
            Boo!
            Ha, ha!
            No!
            ( screaoing )
            Nice working with you!
            Get it open!
            -I'm trying!
            -Open the door!
            Come on, get in here!
            ( Boo crying )
            ( grunting )
            Boo!
            ( panting )
            ( panting )
            There they are!
            Sulley, what are you doing?
            Sulley!
            ( grunts )
            ( grunts )
            ( yells )
            Looks like we caught
            the express, pal.
            Do you see them?
            Straight ahead!
            No...
            ( stifled cry )
            ( grunting nervously )
            Kitty!
            Boo!
            ( yelling )
            ( whiopering )
            RAND ALL:
            Look at everybody's
            favourite scarer now!
            You stupid, pathetic waste!
            ( thuop )
            You've been number one
            for too long, Sullivan.
            Now your time is up!
            And don't worry.
            I'll take good care of the kid.
            No!
            ( yelling )
            ( Boo grunting
            ~ and Randall gagging )
            ( Randall groaning )
            ( gagging )
            ( roaring angrily )
            She's not scared
            of you any more.
            ( roars angrily )
            Looks like you're out of a job.
            ( gulps )
            All right, come on,
            over the plate.
            Let's see
            the ol' stuff here, pal.
            Come on, now, chuck him,
            chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.
            Hum, baby,
            here's the pitch.
            Wait, please, don't,
            don't, don't!
            No!
            And he is...
            out of here!
            ( crickets chirping )
            BO Y:
            Mama, another gator
            got in the house.
            Another gator?!
            Give me that shovel!
            Come here!
            ( clanging, yelling )
            Get him, Mama!
            Get that gator!
            Care to do the honours,
            Mikey?
            With pleasure.
            ( thud )
            ( baby talk )
            That's right, Boo.
            You did it.
            You beat him.
            ( raspberry )
            Come on.
            Okay, Boo,
            it's time to go home.
            Take care of yourself,
            and be a good girl, okay?
            ( gasps )
            Oh, no!
            The power's out!
            Make her laugh again.
            All right, I got a move here.
            It'll bring down the house.
            Up...
            ( oetallic clang )
            ( groans softly )
            Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.
            What?! What'd you do,
            forget to check
            if her stupid hood was up
            ya big dope?!
            ( singsong ):
            Uncle Mike, try not to yell
            in front of her.
            You know we still need her
            to laugh.
            Right.
            ( laughs )
            Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!
            ( gibberish )
            Funny, right? Huh?
            See what the...
            These are the jokes, kid.
            Whoa!
            What's happening?
            SULLEY:
            Hold on!
            When the door lands
            in this station, cut the power.
            You'll have the child
            and the criminals responsible
            for this whole mess.
            Great.
            A welcoming committee!
            What are we going to do?!
            ( electrical huooing )
            ( clang )
            This is the CD A.
            Come out slowly
            with the child
            in plain sight.
            Okay, okay.
            You got us.
            Here we are.
            Here's the kid.
            I'm cooperating.
            But before you take us away,
            I have one thing to say:
            ( gags )
            Catch!
            ( all shouting ):
            We have a toxic
            projectile!
            Halt! After the suspect!
            Cover the area!
            Bring in reinforcements!
            WATERNOOSE:
            Stop him!
            ( Boo squeaks )
            Come on.
            Don't let them get away.
            What...?!
            No, wait, wait!
            Come back!
            He has the child!
            ( frustrated growl )
            ( Boo squeaks )
            Sullivan? Sullivan!
            Give me the child!
            Me not go!
            Give her to me!
            ( panting )
            ( grunts )
            ( oetallic creaking )
            WATERNOOSE:
            Open this door!
            Open this door!
            ( growling and pounding )
            Hey!
            Sullivan!
            ( yells )
            WATERNOOSE:
            Don't do it.
            ( beep )
            Come on.
            Don't go in that room!
            ( yelling )
            I think we stopped him, Boo.
            You're safe now.
            You be a good girl, okay?
            This has gone
            far enough,James.
            She's home now!
            Just leave her alone!
            I can't do that!
            She's seen too much.
            You both have.
            It doesn't have to be this way.
            I have no choice!
            Times have changed.
            Scaring isn't enough any more.
            But kidnapping children?!
            I'll kidnap
            a thousand children
            before I let
            this company die
            and I'll silence anyone
            who gets in my way!
            No!
            ( child's voice ):
            Good night, Mom.
            ( wooan's voice ):
            Good night, sweetheart.
            Good night, Mom.
            What, wh-what is this?!
            What? Who? Huh?
            COMPUTER:
            Simulation terminated.
            Simulation terminated.
            Well, I don't know
            about the rest of you guys
            but I spotted
            several big mistakes.
            But-but-but how-how did...?
            How did...?
            MIKE:
            You know what?
            Let's watch my favourite part
            again... shall we?
            ( repeating ):
            I'll kidnap a thousand children
            before I let this company die.
            What...? Wha...?
            I'll kidnap
            a thousand children before...
            ( baby talk )
            Shh, shh, shh, shh!
            Shh!
            I'll get him.
            All right,
            come with us, sir.
            Wh-what are
            you doing?
            Take your
            hands off me!
            You can't arrest me!
            I hope you're happy, Sullivan!
            You've destroyed this company.
            Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
            Where will everyone
            get their scream now?!
            The energy crisis
            will only get worse
            because of you!
            ( loud clang )
            Stay where you are.
            Huh?
            Number One
            wants to talk to you.
            Attention!
            Hello, boys.
            BOTH:
            Roz?!
            Two and a half years
            of undercover work
            were almost wasted
            when you intercepted
            that child, Mr Sullivan.
            Of course, without your help,
            I never would have known
            that this went all the way up
            to Waternoose.
            ( baby talk )
            ( gasps )
            ROZ:
            Now...
            about the girl...
            I just want to
            send her home.
            Very good.
            ( chioing tones )
            Bring me a door shredder.
            What, you mean... you mean,
            I can't see her again?
            That's the way it has to be.
            I'll give you
            five minutes.
            ( whirring huo )
            Well, so long, kid.
            Mike Wazowski!
            Yeah.
            Ah, Boo,
            it's been fun.
            Go ahead.
            Go grow up.
            ( door creaking )
            ( squealing in delight )
            ( laughing )
            Uh-uh, B-Boo...?
            ( speaking baby talk )
            Um... Boo?
            ( speaking baby talk )
            Oh, look at that.
            Yeah, you know...
            Oh, that's cute, yeah.
            ( baby talk )
            Uh, Boo, um...
            ( squeaking toy )
            Well, that's very nice.
            ( giggling )
            Come here, you!
            ( squeals )
            ( both laughing )
            Oh, he's a happy bear...
            ( giggling )
            ( baby talk )
            Nothing's coming
            out of your closet
            to scare you
            any more, right?
            Mm...
            Yeah.
            Goodbye, Boo.
            Kitty.
            Kitty has to go.
            Boo!
            ( gasps )
            Kitty?
            ( ootor buzzing loudly )
            ( clicks off )
            None of this
            ever happened, gentlemen.
            And I don't want to see
            any paperwork on this.
            ( door closes )
            Take him away.
            ( all ourouring )
            I bet we get
            the rest of the day off.
            You idiot!
            They're going
            to shut down the factory!
            ( all gasp )
            I'm telling you, pal,
            when that wall went up
            you should have seen the look
            on Waternoose's face.
            Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
            a copy of that tape.
            Hey, you all right?
            Come on, pal,
            cheer up, we did it!
            We got Boo home.
            Ah, sure, we put the factory
            in the toilet, and...
            gee, hundreds of people
            will be out of work now.
            Not to mention the angry mob
            that'll come after us
            when there's no more power,
            but, hey...
            at least we had
            some laughs, right?
            Laughs...
            ( crickets chirping )
            ( wind blowing softly )
            ( door quietly creaks open )
            ( boy gasps )
            Hey, is this thing on?
            Hello?
            Hello?
            Testing, testing.
            Hey, good evening.
            How are you?
            How are you?
            Nice to see you.
            I tell you, it's good
            to be here in... your room.
            Where you from?
            Never mind.
            You're in
            kindergarten, right?
            Oh, I love kindergarten.
            Best three years of my life.
            Of my life.
            But I love sports.
            Dodgeball was the best.
            Oh, yeah.
            I was the fastest one out there.
            Course I was the ball.
            But I...
            was the ball, see?
            All right.
            ( ruobling )
            ( ruobling gets louder )
            ( gurgling )
            Ah...
            ( huge burp )
            Ah?
            ( laughing )
            Hey, thanks a lot.
            I'll be here all week.
            Remember to tip your waitresses.
            ( guffawing )
            ( rippling gurgle )
            ( bell dings )
            Great job, Mikey.
            You filled your quota on
            the first kid of the day.
            Not bad, huh?
            You know, only somebody
            with perfect comedic timing
            could produce this much energy
            in one shot.
            Uh-huh, and the fact
            that laughter is
            ten times more
            powerful than scream
            had nothing to do with it.
            ( clears throat )
            CELIA:
            Oh, Googley Bear.
            Come here, you.
            Schmoopsie-poo!
            Googley.
            Whoa!
            ( snakes chittering )
            ( Mike giggling )
            Girls!
            Girls, put...
            Stop, stop, stop!
            Michael,
            you're such a charmer.
            Hey, did you bring
            the magazine?
            They just delivered
            a whole box.
            Let me see it!
            ( laughing )
            Sulley and I
            made the cover, right?
            ( whispering ):
            I don't believe it.
            ( syopathetically ):
            ~Googley Bear...
            I'm on the cover
            of a magazine!
            Ow!
            ( chattering )
            ( jittering blubbers )
            Oh, this is great!
            ( huooing happily )
            ( child laughing uproariously )
            ( bell dings )
            Oh.
            ( distant laughter )
            ( kazoo whirs )
            ( toy horn toots )
            MIKE:
            Hey, Sulley!
            ( yells )
            Hey, uh, Mike.
            I was, uh, just...
            Well, listen,
            if you got a minute
            there's something
            I want to show you.
            But-but-but...
            Okay, close your eyes.
            Follow me.
            Come on.
            I-I-I...
            No peeking.
            Keep coming,
            keep coming,
            keep coming.
            Come on,
            keep coming.
            Keep coming,
            keep coming.
            Mike...
            Follow the sultry
            sound of my voice.
            Okay, stop.
            Open them.
            Ta-da!
            Mike...
            is that...?
            Sorry it took
            so long, pal.
            It was a lot of wood
            to go through.
            You know,
            it only works
            if you have
            every piece.
            ( whirring huo )
            ( creaking )
            Boo?
            BOO:
            Kitty!
            ( bouncy blues oelody plays )
            -Speed.
            -Marker.
            And... action.
            SULLEY:
            If I were a rich man
            With a million or two
            MIKE:
            I'd live in
            a penthouse
            In a room
            with a view
            And if I were handsome
            No way.
            It could happen.
            Those dreams
            do come true
            I wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have you
            Wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have
            Wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have
            Wouldn't have nothing...
            ( giggling )
            DIRECTOR:
            Okay, cut.
            ( flushing )
            Okay, you finished
            now, right?
            Hello?
            Hello.
            ( yells )
            ( laughs )
            ( both laugh )
            Come on, get lost, you two.
            You're making him
            lose his focus.
            Oh, sorry.
            See you later, fellas.
            Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.
            You idiot!
            It's Sullivan, not Solomon!
            What?
            You're messing up the scene!
            Sorry.
            We're never going to work
            in Hollywood again!
            Let me do it over.
            Shut up!
            Keep rolling!
            You're making it worse!
            JERRY:
            Duck and cover, people!
            ( squeaking )
            Hey, thanks, guys.
            That was a close one.
            ( yelling )
            Ta-da!
            ( all laughing )
            Oh, Boo, it's been fun.
            Go ahead.
            Go throw up.
            ( Boo giggles )
            What?
            What did I say?
            What? What?
            Cut.
            Hey, Ted!
            Good morning!
            ( unrealistic roaring )
            Cut.
            Hey, how was that?
            Was I scary?
            Do I get the part?
            Thank you.
            Can I do it again?
            I can be taller!
            Next!
            And action!
            Okay, let's move.
            Let's move, let's move!
            ( yelling )
            ( loud crash )
            Ow!
            ( laughter )
            Can we get a little more wax
            on the floor, please?
            Wait a minute.
            Randall?
            That cheater!
            He's trying
            to boost his numbers!
            There's something else.
            What?!
            Look-lay in the bag-bay.
            I think you mean
            ''Ook-lay in the ag-bay.''
            What? Didn't I...?
            Well, you know, maybe
            you should just take a minute
            and ead-ray
            your ipt-scray.
            ( chuckles )
            You think he's in going
            to come through the closet
            and scare you.
            Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
            Uh, it's empty.
            See?
            Guess who.
            ( laughter )
            Action.
            Hey, what's the...
            ( laughing )
            ( chuckles )
            Okay, very funny.
            Hey, I look good in a suit.
            Marker.
            And action.
            Let her rip.
            Go.
            ( loud whirring )
            Whoa!
            Shut it off!
            Shut it off!
            ( yelling )
            Pull the lever!
            ( yells )
            You're making it worse!
            MIKE:
            But I must admit it
            Big guy, you
            always come through
            I wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have you
            BOTH:
            You and me together
            That's how it
            always should be
            One without the other
            don't mean nothing to me
            Nothing to me...

            Your seat is right
            over there, sir.
            Boo!
            There's a child,
            there's a child
            There's a human child
            Oh, no!
            Running
            'round the restaurant
            This is really wild
            ( screaoing )
            What in heaven's name
            will become of us?
            We who are living
            in Monstropolis?
            ( tinkling crash )
            ( piano segues to ballad )
            All right, Wazowski.
            Tell us where the kid is.
            ( booing and hissing )
            I will never talk!
            Never!
            She's out of our hair
            ( light applause and whistles )
            And just when I dare...
            to care
            She says, ''au contraire''
            You're my pair...
            of friends
            I love you.
            ( sobbing loudly )
            Keep it together, man!
            And so we put that kid
            back where she came from
            And she helped us to find
            A better tomorrow today!
            Thank you!
            What a night for my mother
            to be in the audience!
            Ladies and gentlemen
            my mom!
            ( whistling loudly )
            Thank you, Monstropolis!
            BOTH:
            I don't have to say it
            SULLEY:
            Ah, say it anyway.
            MIKE:
            'Cause we...
            Both know it's true
            I wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have
            I wouldn't have
            nothing if I didn't have
            I wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have you
            Wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have you.
            ( Music ends )
            One more time.
            ( ousic begins again )
            It worked!
            I don't have to say it
            I'm gonna anyway!
            'Cause we both
            know it's true
            Let's take it
            home, big guy.
            BOTH:
            I wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have
            I wouldn't have
            nothing if I didn't have
            I wouldn't have nothing
            if I didn't have you
            You, you
            A, E, I, O...
